Some refractory symptoms at the end of life (pain, delirium, distress, dyspnoea) might be managed by analgesia, but in high doses, adverse effects (e.g. respiratory depression) can hasten death. Sedation may be needed for agitation or distress and can be administered as continuous deep sedation (also referred to as terminal or palliative sedation) generally using benzodiazepines. However, for some patients these interventions are not enough, and others may express a clear desire to be completely unconscious as they die. We summarise the historical background of an established practice that we refer to as ‘general anaesthesia in end-of-life care’. We discuss its contexts and some ethical and legal issues that it raises, arguing that these are largely similar issues to those already raised by continuous deep sedation. To be a valid option, general anaesthesia in end-of-life care will require a clear multidisciplinary framework and consensus practice guidelines. We see these as an impending development for which the specialty should prepare. General anaesthesia in end-of-life care raises an important debate about the possible role of anaesthesia in the relief of suffering beyond the context of surgical/diagnostic interventions.\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nThere is a potential role for general anaesthesia in end-of-life care, something which has been described previously but largely overlooked. We will start by reviewing the current place of sedation in end-of-life care and show how general anaesthesia is an extension of existing practices. However, introducing general anaesthesia in end-of-life care also requires an examination of the associated ethical, medicolegal and practical implications. We stress that general anaesthesia in end-of-life care is not a form of assisted dying or euthanasia, which are illegal in the UK.\\nThe current role of sedation in end-of- life care\\u2028Many symptoms (delirium, dyspnoea and pain) can become resistant to treatment at the end of life. Up to 84% of patients are reported to require opioids. Additional interventions familiar to anaesthetists include the use of non-opiate medications, epidural and intrathecal regional anaesthesia, local anaesthesia infiltration or blocks, and even acupuncture or nerve stimulation [6]. Some patients may need antidepressants (which have analgesic properties in the context of chronic pain) or benzodiazepines to aid sleep and antipsychotics to manage delirium. The palliative care formulary lists agents used at the end of life and examples of approaches used can be found in national and individual hospital guidelines.\\nPatients who are dying are particularly vulnerable to the cardiorespiratory adverse effects of some agents (e.g. opioids, midazolam, phenobarbital, ketamine). While there is little evidence that these occur with judicious use [5, 10], it is important that fear of such adverse effects does not lead to restrictive treatment practices. The so-called ‘doctrine of double effect’ legally and ethically permits the intentional relief of suffering, even where it is foreseen that there is a significant risk of adverse effects that might hasten death.\\nThe specific need for sedation over and above opioid analgesia in end-of-life care is variable, reported as being between 3% and 51% in different case series. This may reflect differences in local practices\\u2006 \\u2006 and the host of different terms used, including: ‘palliative sedation’, ‘terminal sedation’ or ‘continuous deep sedation’. In this paper, we will use the latter term. Current UK guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), supported by the Royal College of Anaesthetists, makes no specific recommendations about sedation, and instead constitutes broad principles underlying the management of end-of-life care.\\nRegardless of the intended level of sedation, what is actually experienced by patients receiving continuous deep sedation varies. Some patients are lightly sedated, others are mostly unconscious, stirring intermittently or only in response to vigorous stimulation, while others are almost anaesthetised. In part, this is because a variety of techniques, drugs and doses are used. Benzodiazepines are employed commonly (usually midazolam), but other drugs, including barbiturates (such as phenobarbital), are also prescribed. Moreover, ‘sedation’ encompasses a continuous spectrum, with anxiolysis in an awake patient at one extreme and a state approaching general anaesthesia' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' at the other. There is no clear clinical or neuroscientific cut- off between these states of loss of consciousness, and the term ‘dysanaesthesia’ has been used to describe one such ‘in-between’ state. Sedation typically means that verbal contact with the patient is retained; that is, they are co- operative when aroused. By contrast, general anaesthesia refers to a state where the patient is unarousable even to painful stimuli.\\nPatients’ desire to be unconscious Patients have different wishes in relation to suffering and its alleviation. Sigmund Freud, when dying of throat cancer, preferred to have a clear head and ‘think in torment’, refusing analgesia or sedation. Others may have the opposite preference. In a recent survey, 88% of a large online survey of the UK public expressed a wish to have the option of unconsciousness at the end of life.\\nThe desire to be unconscious as a means of eliminating the experience of physical or mental suffering is understandable. Unconsciousness achieves the highest probability of being unaware that the body is going through an adverse process, since even that awareness may be psychologically traumatic to some. This is recognised in other very different contexts. For example, requests by healthy patients for general anaesthesia for minor surgery (e.g. dental extraction) are viewed as entirely acceptable by anaesthetists and by society, even when it is clear that mild sedation (or none at all) would be sufficient to avoid pain, and that anaesthesia poses a greater risk of adverse events. This is out of respect for patients’ autonomy. At the end of life, patients may experience feelings of sadness, fear, anxiety, loneliness, vulnerability, embarrassment and loss of dignity, in addition to pain, suffocation and other suffering, not all of which may be relieved by targeted treatments.\\nPatients’ expectations of unconsciousness:\\u2028We now know that when many patients agree to ‘sedation’, they are in fact expecting to be unconscious. The proportion of patients who report being ‘accidentally aware’ during surgical interventions was higher when patients were sedated than when they received general anaesthesia. Moreover, it has become apparent that patients appearing to be unconscious in several situations may in fact not be. Patients who are critically ill, or those with severe head injury diagnosed as being in deep coma, have reported recall of events in critical care. This also appears to be the case with current terminal sedation techniques, where bispectral index scores can remain > 60 in patients who appeared unconscious. In patients diagnosed as being in a vegetative state, studies show that some apparently unconscious patients can reliably generate appropriate electroencephalographic responses to stimuli\\u2006 \\u2006 or commands and in some cases communicate ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers (as evidenced by functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns ). This raises the possibility that some patients who are dying may be suffering when otherwise believed not to be.\\n\\nGeneral anaesthesia in end-of-life care in practice: rediscovering the Moyle protocol\\u2028Perhaps the first description of using general anaesthesia in end-of-life care was in 1995 by John Moyle, a consultant anaesthetist and palliative care physician. Moyle recognised the limitations of conventional approaches as discussed above (J. Moyle, personal communication). Moyle developed a protocol for infusing the then relatively new anaesthetic agent propofol and described its use in two patients, who died peacefully after 4 and 9 days of continuous infusion. In the same year, a similar case and protocol was reported in Italy. Since then, propofol infusions in end-of-life care have been described regularly, albeit infrequently, in the palliative care literature.\\nMoyle anticipated some technical challenges with his protocol. Intravenous induction of anaesthesia by bolus invariably results in potent respiratory and cardiovascular depression. The former is associated with apnoea and upper airway collapse. If the anaesthetist does not provide airway support, induction of anaesthesia itself becomes life terminating. These respiratory adverse effects do not occur as rapidly as with benzodiazepine sedatives like midazolam, and these agents can be reversed with flumazenil. Similarly, any excessive respiratory depression by opiates can be reversed promptly using naloxone. Hypotension and cardio- depressive effects might also hasten the process of dying if not managed using appropriate drugs or intravenous fluids.\\nTo avoid these complications, Moyle and others recommended very slow intravenous infusion by a pump at a carefully titrated dose (e.g. just 5 mg.h-1 vs. the 100– 200 mg typically used as a bolus). The depth of anaesthesia achieved was inadequate for a surgical procedure, but was ideal for an undisturbed' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' dying patient. In a case series of 22 patients from a Swedish specialist palliative care unit, propofol infusions were provided in this way for continuous deep sedation for between 1 and 14 days (median 5 days). Notably, the protocol developed and used by Moyle did not require the level of continuous patient monitoring that might be necessary during surgical general anaesthesia.\\nThis is not to imply that propofol is an anaesthetic whereas other drugs like benzodiazepines are not. Any suitable sedative given in sufficient doses will achieve unresponsiveness to painful stimulation. Rather, the distinctive element of this approach is the intended purpose of achieving general anaesthesia, rather than sedation.\\nUpdating the Moyle protocol for anaesthesia in end-of-life care\\u2028Since Moyle’s description, there have been about 25 publications, case series and reviews of intended general anaesthesia using propofol infusions at the end of life. One international perspective is relevant. Since 2016, terminally ill patients in France have a legal right to unconsciousness once it is deemed they are dying, sustained until the point of death. This has been labelled the ‘French exception’ emphasising the unique character of the French legal code in this regard. As a result, the Haute Autorite de Sante (the body responsible for setting medical standards) has issued clear guidance on how ‘end of life’ is to be defined, what protective steps should be taken to achieve medical consensus that sedation is desirable and the means of administering it. These guidelines refer primarily to the use of intravenous midazolam but mention that propofol may also be used with expert anaesthetic input. This is, therefore, a strong official implication that anaesthetists might, or should, be directly involved. The guidelines do not offer technical details, but it is theoretically straightforward to update Moyle’s established protocol to the modern era, where propofol target-controlled infusions are commonly used in anaesthesia.\\nUltra-slow intravenous induction is now described in at least two contexts. One is to mimic an inhalational induction of anaesthesia (spontaneous respiration using intravenous anaesthesia, STRIVE). The second is in basic neuroscience experimentation, where ultra-slow propofol target-controlled infusions (0.2 μg.ml-1 increments over 50 min) are titrated to maintain spontaneous respiration while volunteers are lying in a functional MRI scanner. Interestingly, these experiments have revealed brain activity patterns of ‘thalamic isolation’, temporally associated with the behavioural effect of the subjects becoming inattentive or disinterested in their surroundings, consistent with the notion of dysanaesthesia. Specific adaptations of methods like these have been discussed by Bodnar; further technical details are outside the scope of this article but should be self-evident to most anaesthetists. \\nEthical issues\\nOne key argument in favour of anaesthesia in end-of-life care revolves around the significance of patient preference and their personal concept of a good death. General anaesthesia in end-of-life care is not intended to replace analgesia or sedation for symptom control. However, it should be an additional option for those who want more reliable or complete loss of consciousness than can be offered currently. Some patients may choose general anaesthesia in end-of-life care only once these other modalities have been attempted and, in their experience, failed. However, others may choose it as a first choice once death is imminent. Others, perhaps the majority, might not require or request it at all.\\nRespecting patient autonomy in this way does not imply that the final decision about therapy belongs solely to the patient, nor that general anaesthesia in end-of-life care should be available on request to any patient at any time. We set out some proposed conditions for the institution of general anaesthesia in end-of-life care\\nbelow, based on the French experience. Instead, decision-making should, as ever, be a dynamic process between the patient and their families, and the medical staff (including physician, nurses and other carers) which engages both clinical expertise and patient values and preferences.\\nOffering effective treatments:\\nIt is a fundamental ethical principle in medicine that doctors should promote and act in patients’ best interests (beneficence), and by extension, offer them the therapy option most likely to achieve the desired outcome. If a competent, dying patient wishes to be unconscious (and not just sedated) as a specifically stated aim to help relieve their suffering, then general anaesthesia in end-of-life care provides the greatest assurance of meeting this wish and is, therefore, in the best interests of the patient.\\nStudies of surgical anaesthesia indicate that patients unambiguously requesting general anaesthesia are not satisfied (and indeed, may suffer long' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text='-term psychological distress) if sedation is provided instead. If sedation at the end of life leaves the patient in a semi-conscious state but unable to communicate meaningfully, there is concern they would have severely aversive experiences similar to, or even worse than, patients who have reported distressing ‘accidental awareness’ during surgery. We now know that unconsciousness is better achieved with intended general anaesthesia. In the absence of neuromuscular blocking drugs, the incidence of accidental awareness is in the order of 1 in 136,000.\\nInformed consent\\nIt is important that patients are informed of all the options available to them in relation to the relief of suffering at the end of life: analgesia, sedation and, potentially now, anaesthesia. The risks and benefits of each should be explained. Patients should be free to choose the option, or sequence of options or combination of options, which best meet their values (autonomy), consistent with distributive justice.\\nHowever, general anaesthesia in end-of-life care creates a situation in which autonomy is more reliably and irreversibly lost. Patients will not be able to change their minds or revise their decision. This is not a problem unique to general anaesthesia in end-of-life care, as it is already potentially the case with continuous deep sedation. It is resolved through careful prior consent, where a patient choosing either general anaesthesia in end-of-life care or continuous deep sedation needs to be aware in advance that their decision is likely irreversible. This is not something ever made explicit in consent for general anaesthesia in surgery but it is self-evident that a patient cannot change their mind after induction of anaesthesia. Because anaesthetists are trained to obtain consent for anaesthesia from which the patient is expected to recover, the very different aim of general anaesthesia in end-of-life care may require additional training. This is not addressed in existing consent guidelines, and may necessitate the involvement of other specialties. Consent should also include the possibility that the patient awakens during extended general anaesthesia in end-of-life care (e.g. due to interruption of infusion, altered sensitivity to agent, prolonged process of dying, etc.).\\nAvoidance of hastening death:\\nThere may be a concern (in our view, misplaced) that anaesthesia in end-of-life care will, unintentionally, hasten death. There is no statistically significant difference in mean survival time between patients at the end of life who receive continuous deep sedation and those who do not. Data are limited for general anaesthesia in end-of- life care but a propofol infusion has been continued for up to 14 days without suppressing spontaneous breathing, and in another study in paediatric oncology patients, propofol was continued for up to 10 days; these do not appear foreshortened times to death. None of the studies describing the technique suggest death was hastened.\\nIn law, the possibility of medical interventions at the end of life unintentionally hastening death is covered by the ‘doctrine of double effect’, as discussed above. If it is wrongly assumed that general anaesthesia in end-of-life care (being anaesthesia) is inherently and prohibitively riskier than continuous deep sedation (which is sedation), then there may arise a concern that this doctrine may not be applied by courts or regulators because they judge there to be, in their minds, a safer alternative. However, there is no empirical evidence in this or any other context that deep sedation is inherently safer than anaesthesia.\\nTo minimise concerns about hastening death, one practical option for anaesthesia in end-of-life care would be to limit its application to patients who are predicted to die within a period of up to 14 days, as suggested in the French guidance. The rationale for this timeframe is that beyond 14 days, there may be concerns that malnutrition would constitute a foreseeable, independent and avoidable contributor to death. Moreover, with general anaesthesia in end-of-life care, the patient is unable to chew and swallow, and even nasogastric tube feeding may lead to regurgitation and aspiration, precipitating respiratory failure. Whether intravenous hydration should be continued or avoided, is a matter of separate clinical judgement which should involve consulting the patient (if they can participate in decision-making), their surrogate or reviewing an advance directive (if available).\\nSetting an upper limit of 14 days for the administration of anaesthesia in end-of-life care might, however, raise another dilemma if the patient does not die within that time frame. One option would be to awaken and reassess the patient, their wishes, and their medical status. Dying is a very uncertain and unpredictable process. However, this is not a unique problem to anaesthesia in end-of-life care and could be addressed' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' in the same way as other existing interventions (e.g. continuous deep sedation) and decisions in palliative care where patients survive for longer than anticipated initially.\\n\\nFundamental human rights:\\nThree relevant fundamental rights are already established in law, or by custom and practice: patients with a terminal illness have a right to access palliative care, which includes a right to analgesia and anxiolysis including sedation\\u2006 \\u2006 and (in France) a right to unconsciousness; patients have a right to refuse life-prolonging treatment (including artificial nutrition and hydration) at any time; and patients have a right to choose general anaesthesia over clinically effective alternatives when they undergo interventions that might confer suffering (commonly surgery or diagnostic procedures). We can then draw together these individual rights to justify the use of general anaesthesia in end-of-life care to manage suffering. Terminally ill patients should have a right to the option of anaesthesia as they approach the end of their life.\\nIt is important to stress that while general anaesthesia in end-of-life care should be an option, it is an open question how many patients would choose it. Other than the evidence from the palliative care literature that describes anaesthesia in end-of-life care, we cannot estimate the size of the unmet need. However, even if only a few would choose it, that alone does not provide an ethical objection.\\nEthics of resource allocation and distributive justice:\\nThe practice of general anaesthesia in end-of-life care prima facie requires expert anaesthetic input, an additional resource requirement to more conventional forms of end- of-life care. Additional support may also be necessary for training. This might generate opposing ethical dilemmas. If general anaesthesia in end-of-life care is ethically justified, then it is important to allocate resources to provide it, which might then reduce anaesthesia resources to support surgical services. Conversely, if anaesthesia capacity is limited by commitments to surgery, then terminal patients may be denied care to which they have a right. The costs of providing it as an option would need to be factored into planning models for end-of-life care at a national level.\\nLegal perspectives:\\nPatient perspective:\\nIf the option of general anaesthesia in end-of-life care is not widely known or used, then patients may not be offered it in the first place. Therefore, professionals need to be aware of it, and also be assured of a supportive professional framework. Regardless, a motivated, well-informed patient could request anaesthesia in end-of-life care and this may become a driver for change. The ‘French exception’ is clearly consistent with the European Convention on Human\\nRights and does not conflict with any other laws prohibiting euthanasia in France. This cannot be extrapolated automatically to the UK, but the principles could be used by a UK petitioner (patient) to assert an equivalent ‘right to unconsciousness’. At the very least, it would be fascinating to observe if or how a UK Supreme Court that requires doctors to share with patients the risks and benefits of all treatment options that are ‘materially important to them’ (under the ‘Montgomery principle’) would decide such a case.\\nPhysician perspective:\\nIn practice, any future request for general anaesthesia in end-of-life care in the UK would be expected to arise from a hospice patient’s supervising palliative care physician or general practitioner, directed to an anaesthetist. Regardless of the willingness or competence of an anaesthetist to provide this service, there would be practical issues in the management of drugs and devices (e.g. where they would be obtained from, maintained, etc.).\\nAdministering general anaesthesia as part of end-of-life care is not expressly prohibited by UK law, which does not stipulate limits on the purposes for which general anaesthesia should be administered. Nevertheless, it will be a concern in the minds of many physicians that any interventions they make at the end of life may be misconstrued, with the threat of investigation, sanction or serious criminal prosecution. As noted above, the ‘doctrine of double effect’ is potentially protective, and the related practice of continuous deep sedation is well established. Since general anaesthesia in end-of-life care has already been described in the UK and several other European countries, this literature base represents a ‘responsible body of medical opinion’ and, as suggested above, a reasonable one. However, there may be a practical limitation to using the existing literature base in any defence as it might be difficult to locate a UK physician actually practising the technique to support it. Moreover, any individual administering anaesthesia in end-of-life care might' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",

Despite the severity of the problem, no evidence exists as to the safest anaesthetic technique for the mother and foetus couple undergoing CS for AFD. We aimed to compare general anaesthesia (GA) versus regional (spinal and epidural) anaesthesia in terms of their perioperative maternal and foetal outcomes.\\nMethods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the medical records of all women who underwent CS indicated for AFD between 2015 to 2018 at the Douala General Hospital, Cameroon. Medical records of neonates were also reviewed. We sought to investigate the association between GA, and regional anaesthesia administered during CS for AFD and foetal and maternal outcomes. The threshold of statistical significance was set at 0.05.\\nResults: We enrolled the medical records of 117 pregnant women who underwent CS indicated for AFD. Their mean age and mean gestational age were 30.5 ± 4.8 years and 40 weeks respectively. Eighty-three (70.9%), 29 (24.8%) and 05 (4.3%) pregnant women underwent CS under SA, GA and EA respectively. Neonates delivered by CS under GA were more likely to have a significantly low APGAR score at both the 1st (RR = 1.93, p = 0.014) and third- minute (RR = 2.52, p = 0.012) and to be resuscitated at birth (RR = 2.15, p = 0.015). Past CS, FHR pattern on CTG didn’t affect these results in multivariate analysis. Adverse maternal outcomes are shown to be higher following SA when compared to GA.\\nConclusion: The study infers an association between CS performed for AFD under GA and foetal morbidity. This, however, failed to translate into a difference in perinatal mortality when comparing GA vs RA. This finding does not discount the role of GA, but we emphasize the need for specific precautions like adequate anticipation for neonatal resuscitation to reduce neonatal complications associated with CS performed for AFD under GA.\\n\\nBackground: \\nAcute foetal distress (AFD) is defined as sudden lack or shortage of oxygen supply via the bloodstream to the foetus, leading to foetal hypoxia, hypercapnia and meta- bolic acidosis. It is a non-specific term which engulfs abnormal clinical findings suggestive of a com- promised foetal wellbeing most often seen during the intrapartum period. AFD clinically manifests with an abnormal foetal heart rate (tachycardia ≥160 beats/minutes or bradycardia ≤110 beats/minutes) on cardiotocography (CTG), intermittent doppler or hand-held fetoscope auscultation. It is a foetal and obstetrical emergency, complicating up to 2% of all pregnancies and accounting for 8.9% of births due to caesarean section (CS) especially in developing countries. Mortality still remains high at 31.25 per 1000 deliveries, especially when the interval between the start of AFD and childbirth exceeds 30 min. The management of AFD requires the safest and fastest possible route of delivery to prevent avert perinatal morbidity and mortality compounded after delivery by neonatal asphyxia (NA) or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.\\nHowever, there is an on-going debate on the safest anaesthetic technique for CS indicated for AFD in anaesthesiology. This is more challenging in low-income countries (LICs), due to insufficient health infrastructure, unfunded and unstaffed healthcare systems. Comparing regional (spinal and epidural) to general techniques of anaesthesia, although general anaesthesia (GA) has the merit of rapidity in induction of anaesthesia which is invaluable for this obstetrical emergency, (AFD), when compared to regional anaesthesia techniques (RATs)\\u2006 \\u2006 GA could have deleterious and potentially lethal consequences to neonates born through CS performed under GA. This is due to the trans- placental passage of hypnotics, and opioids derivatives which can lead to depression of cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological functions of the neonate. This later could be associated with neonatal resuscitation in- tensive care unit admission and nosocomial infections in the neonate. RATs, though associated' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' with better APGA R scores both in the 1st and 5th minutes following delivery take a longer time to be realized, a factor non- desirable in women undergoing CS indicated for AFD. This delay in induction time for a foetus in acute distress may worsen the consequences of AFD such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, neo- natal anaemia, metabolic acidosis in the new-born and ultimately, death. However, studies are yet to prove this hypothesis if true. Also, RATs have been shown to be associated with less maternal blood loss and greater post- operative satisfaction in elective CS, but not in the case of AFD. A systematic review of 22 randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies by the Cochrane group assessed the effects of RATs versus GA on maternal and neonatal outcomes following CS. However, most studies included in the review involved elective CS with only two studies involving emergency CS for AFD. Their findings, therefore, cannot be readily applied to women undergoing anaesthesia for emergency CS in AFD. There is, therefore, a need for more studies com- paring both RAT and GA for CS indicated for AFD to generate more evidence required for decision making in daily clinical practice.\\nAgainst this background, we sought to compare the maternal and neonatal outcomes of women undergoing emergency CS for AFD under either RATs or GA. The research goal was to contribute to providing information necessary, to generate evidence for the safest anaesthetic technique in the case of this emergency.\\n\\nMethods: \\nStudy design and setting\\nThe study was carried out and reported in accordance to the STROBE checklist for cohort studies. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Douala General Hospital (DGH), Douala, Cameroon. Douala is an urban zone and the economical capital of Cameroon with a population 3 million inhabitants. The DGH is a university teaching hospital and one of the major reference hospitals in Cameroon. It has an Obstetrics and Gynaecology department, a Neonatal unit and an Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care department. Its neonatal unit serves as the main referral neonatal unit for all health centres in Douala and its environs. Every year, an average of 1100 childbirths occur in its Obstetrics and Gynaecology department\\u2006 \\u2006 some within the delivery room (in case of vaginal delivery) and others within the operating room of the department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care.\\nSampling and study participants\\nA chart review of the obstetrical and anaesthesiology re- cords was conducted for all consecutive parturients who underwent an emergency CS indicated for AFD between January 01, 2015, to August 31, 2018. We also reviewed the records of the neonates of these women who delivered via emergency CS. We excluded parturients with contraindications for regional anaesthesia (coagulation abnormalities, infection at the point of lumbar puncture, and haemodynamic instability, pre-existing neurological pathologies such as epilepsy, space occupying lesions or radiculopathies) as well as cases of extreme emergencies such as cord prolapse.\\nVariables studied\\nData extracted from the obstetrical and anaesthesiology records of parturients and neonates included maternal age, past history (parity, gravidity, comorbidities and previous CS), the anaesthesia technique whether regional (spinal or epidural) or general. Parameters specific to anaesthesiology consultation included ASA score and intubability criteria namely the mallampati score. Information on perioperative complications (immediate and late) such as post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), postdural puncture headache (PDPH), postoperative wound infection and duration of hospitalisation were also collected. Pathologic cardiotocographic (CTG) tracings were used to group patients into two groups of foetal heart rate pattern; non-reassuring and abnormal group, according to the NICE guidelines on intrapartum care. Those with at least 2 non reassuring features were under the ‘non-reassuring group’ and those with an ab- normal feature under the “abnormal group.” Neonatal parameters collected from hospital files of new-borns included gestational age, birth weight, APGAR scores at 1st, 3rd and 5th minutes after delivery, neonatal resuscitation and clinical diagnosis of neonatal asphyxia according to the Sarnat classification. Hospitalization in the neonatal unit as well as its duration was noted. Other maternal parameters included maternal age, gestational age, and referral or not to the DGH. Maternal hypotension was defined as a drop between the pre- anaesthesia and post-induction of anaesthesia systolic blood pressure by 30%.\\nData' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' analysis\\nData was extracted from the medical records of the participants into a structured data collection sheet. The data was entered into Epi-info version 7.1.3.3 software. The primary exposure of interest was the type of anaesthesia administered, whether regional (spinal, epidural) or general anaesthesia (GA). The primary outcomes of interest were the foetal outcomes after delivery which included: APGAR score at the 1st, 3rd and 5th minutes, a clinical diagnosis of neonatal asphyxia according to the Sarnat classification, neonatal resuscitation. We conducted univariable analysis followed by a multivariable analysis to adjust for possible confounders. Risk ratios (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and p-values were calculated to measure associations. Variables with missing data precluding meaningful analyses were excluded. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\nResults\\nSocio-demographic characteristics of parturients\\nA total of 117 women met the eligibility criteria and were included into the study. The mean age was 30.5 ± 4.8 years (range: 18 to 42 years). Among the women included in the study, 18 (15.4%) were referred from other health facilities to DGH for CS delivery. The main\\nreasons for referral included: stationary labour, post- term delivery, acute foetal distress (AFD), pre-eclampsia and preterm labour. The gestational age of pregnancy ranged from 30 to 42 weeks, with a median gestational age of 40 weeks (IQR: 39–40 weeks). The gravidity of participants ranged from 1 to 8 with a median gravidity of 2 (IQR = 1 to 4). Few women, 16 (13.68%) had under- gone a previous CS.\\nNeonatal characteristics\\nMost of the babies born to the participants were males (61.11%). All the neonates were born alive. The APGAR score at birth ranged from 2 to 10, with a median of 8 (IQR 6 to 8). \\nAmongst the new-borns, 42 were diagnosed of neonatal asphyxia giving a cumulative incidence of 35.9%. About two thirds (64.3%) of the new-borns with neonatal asphyxia were classified as Sarnat class 1, meanwhile 21.4 and 14.3% were Sarnat class 2 and 3 respectively. The duration of hospitalization of the new- borns in the neonatal unit ranged from 2 to 43 days with a median of 4days (IQR: 2 to 21days). A total of 29 neonates (24.8%) were resuscitated at birth. \\nClinical parameters of parturients\\nOn admission, most of the parturients had a good general state 112 (95.7%). The ASA score was II in 75 (64.10%), III in 38 (32.48%) and IV in 4 (3.42%) of the parturients. Fever was present in 18 (15.4%) of participants.\\nType of anaesthetic technique used for emergency caesarean section indicated for AFD\\u2028More than two thirds 83 (70.9%) of the participants underwent CS for AFD under spinal anaesthesia (SA); 29 (24.8%) under general anaesthesia; and five (4.3%) under epidural anaesthesia (EA). Parturients who under- went emergency CS for AFD under epidural anaesthesia had the epidural catheter placed before delivery for obstetrical analgesia. This was converted to obstetrical anaesthesia immediately within the operating room when CS was indicated for AFD. Spinal anaesthesia was administered with the patient in the sitting position.\\nAmong patients administered GA, the most used hypnotic for induction was propofol 24 (82.8%). Thiopental and ketamine were used in 3 and 2 parturients, respectively. Bupivacaine (Bupi) with fentanyl as adjuvant was used in 79 (95.2%) patients operated under SA. Bupivacaine only and combinations of Bupi+morphine or Bupi+morphine+Fentanyl were used in two, one and one case, respectively. Bupivacaine was used for epidural anaesthesia. Hypotension during regional anaesthesia was managed with the use of ephedrine in 32 (27.3%) of parturients. The mean interval from induction of anaesthesia to extraction of the foetus in women administered SA (22.4 ± 9.9 min) was significantly longer compared to the interval in women administered GA (8.0 ± 4.9 min) (p < 0.001).\\nMaternal outcome after surgery\\nImmediate postoperative complications were few' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text='. In the GA group, we had one case of Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). In the SA group, there were 2 cases of PPH, one of the cases being complicated by maternal death. Furthermore, one case of severe hypotension was noted. No maternal complications were noted in the epidural anaesthesia group. Duration of hospitalisation of mothers ranged from 3 to 13 days with a mean of 5 days. Mean duration of hospitalization for women who underwent CS under SA was 4.5 days and 4.7 days for GA (p = 0.5154). Late complications observed during hospitalization were seen mostly in postpartum women who underwent SA. These included four cases of postdural puncture headaches, two cases of endometritis, one case of malaria and one case surgical site infection.\\nUnivariable analysis\\nAssociation of predictor variables with APGAR at the first minute\\u2028In univariable analysis, babies born of women who received GA had two-fold increase risk of having a low APGAR score at the first minute compared to babies of women who received SA (RR = 2.00, p = 0.011). Furthermore, neonates born of women with fever almost had a double likelihood of having a low APGAR score at the first minute compared to babies born of women without fever (RR = 1.83, p = 0.035). On the other hand, gravidity, FHR pattern, use of epinephrine, gestational age, birth weight and previous CS were not associated with low APGAR in univariable analysis. \\nAssociation of exposure variables with APGAR at the third minute\\u2028Babies born of women who underwent GA had almost three times the risk of having a low APGAR score at the third minute compared to babies of women who underwent SA (RR = 2.86, p = 0.007). Furthermore, neonates delivered by women with fever had three times the risk of having a low APGAR score at the third minute compared to babies born of women without fever (RR = 3.14, p = 0.002). On the other hand, gravidity, FHR pattern, use of epinephrine, gestational age, birth weight and previous CS were not associated with a low APGAR score at the third minute. \\nAssociation of exposure variables with APGAR at the fifth minute\\u2028The type of anaesthesia administered, maternal fever, gravidity, the type of FHR, use of epinephrine, gestational age, birth weight and previous CS were not significantly associated with low APGAR at the fifth minute. \\nAssociation of exposure variables and neonatal resuscitation\\u2028New-borns of women who underwent GA were twice at risk of being resuscitated compared to those born of women who received spinal anaesthesia (P = 0.015). \\nAssociation of exposure variables with neonatal asphyxia (NNA)\\u2028In univariable analysis, the type of anaesthesia administered was not significantly associated with the clinical diagnosis of NNA. Furthermore, gravidity, the type of FHR pattern, gestational age, birth weight, previous CS, the use of epinephrine and the presence of postoperative fever were not associated with NNA in univariable analysis. \\nAssociation of exposure variables and new-born hospitalization in the neonatal unit\\u2028There was no significant difference in the chances of neonates being hospitalised in the neonatal unit for both SA and GA. However, post term new-borns were about 50% less likely to be hospitalized in the neonatal unit compared to neonates born at term(P = 0.035). Further- more, babies with low birth weights were about twice as likely to be hospitalised (P = 0.001). \\nAssociation of exposure variables and duration of neonatal unit hospitalization\\u2028Neonates born following GA were likely to have a longer mean duration of hospitalisation in the neonatal unit compared to those born under SA 4.7days versus 4.5 days. However, the difference in mean was not statistically significant (p = 0.515).\\nMultivariable analysis\\nAfter accounting for foetal heart rate patterns on CTG, past caesarean scar and whether parturients were referred from another hospital, SA remained significantly associated with better APGAR scores in the first and 3rd minute following Caesarean section, and with lesser risks of resuscitation of new-borns (P<0.05). \\nDiscussions\\nThe aim of our study was to assess the effects of regional versus general anaesthesia on foetal and maternal out- comes following caesarean section for acute foetal distress, to determine the safest anaesthetic technic to use in the case' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' of this emergency. We also sought to analyse the influence of other maternal and foetal factors on foetal and maternal outcomes. We found that unlike SA, GA was associated with lower APGAR scores in the 1st 3rd and 5th minutes following CS. However, this finding was significant for the 1st and 3rd minutes only.\\nOur findings are consistent with those of several other studies in Africa, Europe, and the USA, where GA was seen to be associated with lower APGAR scores, following anaesthesia for AFD. However, unlike our study, their results showed that lower APGAR scores following GA was significant even at the 5th minute following delivery. GA is shown in our study to be associated with significantly higher chances of neonatal resuscitation when compared to SA. We therefore might have thought that neonatal admission and morbidity would have consequently been increased. However, this was not the case in our study as expected. Thangaswamy et al. showed that in Category 1 CS, GA was significantly associated with greater frequency of neonatal unit admissions and mortality. Several studies have shown that neonatal resuscitated babies have higher morbidity and sequalae of neonatal asphyxia. Failure of our study to tie with these findings may infer better resuscitative techniques in the context of DGH for babies born by caesarean section.\\nConfounders studied in the current study included previous CS, foetal heart rate pattern on CTG, and parturients referral from a different hospital. None of these were found to influence the choice of anaesthetic technique. We noticed that, whether patients were referred or not, and no matter the degree of heart rate abnormality, or whether they had had a past caesarean section, foetal outcome were still better if SA and not GA was used for CS. This finding is consistent with previously reported studies. Our study also went further to examine the association of other exposures such as gestational age, birth weight, gravidity, the use of ephedrine and fever on neonatal outcomes. Maternal fever was consistently shown to be associated be associated with lower APGAR scores, significantly so, in the first- and third-minutes following delivery. These results are not surprising and have been confirmed by other studies showing the impact of maternal fever on neonatal outcome. Mothers presenting with fever should therefore be aggressively resuscitated in the perinatal wards prior to delivery to reduce the risks of poor foetal outcomes.\\nMaternal outcomes in our study surprisingly show that, women presenting with AFD who were operated, were likely to have a more favourable outcome if GA instead of SA was the technique of anaesthesia used. This is contrary to findings of other studies. Where regional anaesthesia is found to be associated with better maternal outcomes. Thangaswamy et al. revealed that ICU admission and maternal mortality were also comparable between GA and SA. However further studies will be needed to conclude on these observations.\\nThe present study should also be interpreted in the context of its limitations. Firstly, we were not able to assess some factors such as the interval between the induction of anaesthesia and delivery of the neonate as this is a paramount factor influencing neonatal outcome with respect to anaesthetic technique. Secondly, maternal factors such as blood loss and postoperative pain were not studied. This was due to the retrospective nature of our study as this data was very inconsistently written in the medical records. However, using robust methods, we have contributed to the scarcity of data on the safest anaesthesia technique for CS indicated for AFD. These findings should contribute to informing decision making by anaesthesiologists, who are often confronted with the dilemma of which technique of anaesthesia to choose in this emergency. It has been a common clinical anaesthesia practice to perform GA in this situation. The current study shows that SA is safer than the traditional GA often used.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ufeffUnsettled weather and the end for thiopental? Obstetric general anaesthesia after the NAP5 and MBRRACE-UK reports:\\nLate 2014 saw the publication of two major reports that behove anaesthe- tists to reflect on the current practice of general anaesthesia in obstetrics. The 5th National Audit Project (NAP5) investigated accidental aware- ness under general anaesthesia and produced some important, if not sur- prising, results [1–3]. In keeping with the previous two National Audit Pro- jects, the unique challenges of obstetric anaesthesia were underlined. Just a few months later, the Report on Con- fidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths – now organised and delivered by a new consortium, MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audit and Confidential En- quiries across the UK) – reported its findings for 2009-' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text='12 [4, 5]. At first sight, one might think that the two reports have little to do with each other, with one about patients who wake up during anaesthesia and one about patients who don’t wake up at all. But both of these scenarios are common fears of patients undergoing anaesthesia, and whilst the two studies start in very different places, they con- verge in a number of areas.\\nAwareness and obstetric anaesthesia: a perfect storm\\u2028Even without perusal of the obstetric chapter in NAP5, the risk factors associated with awareness and highlighted in the early part of the report would have started alarm bells ringing for obstetric anaesthetists: obesity; the use of thiopental and neuromuscular blockade; rapid sequence induction; and emergency cases.\\nIn the NAP5 report, 14 cases of awareness in obstetric anaesthesia were reported – approximately 10% of reports – while obstetric general anaesthetics represented only 0.8% of the total general anaesthetics given (though the validity of both numerator and denominator in determining an incidence of awareness is questionable, as pointed out previously). This apparent over-representation of obstetrics reflects what is already known about obstetric general anaesthesia: that it is a high-risk area for anaesthetic awareness. In this regard, perhaps the prominence of obstetrics in the NAP5 report rep- resents a convergence of risk factors identified throughout the report; throw difficult intubation into the mix (all the obstetric cases concerned awareness at induction or soon after, and nine involved a difficult airway) and you have your ‘perfect storm’ of the obese parturient (10 of the 14 cases were obese) presenting to a non-consultant anaesthetist as an emergency, out of hours (the NAP5 activity surveys found that almost two thirds of all anaesthetic activity between 00:01 and 08:00 was obstetric related), requiring a rapid sequence induction (traditionally done with thiopental, a drug with which trainees may have little experience – and that is highlighted in the NAP5 report as being given in an inappropriately low dose for the size of the parturient in seven cases).\\nOne other interesting aspect of NAP5 is that it studied spontaneous reports of awareness; in contrast to other areas of the report, most obstetric cases of awareness were reported on the same day or the day following anaesthesia. Routine follow-up of women who receive anaesthetic intervention (especially general anaesthesia) is carried out in most obstetric units; could obstetric patients be more likely to report awareness, perhaps in part through more rigorous early anaesthetic follow-up, as well as (or even, rather than) more likely to experience it?\\nThe obstetric chapter\\u2006 \\u2006 ends with five specific recommendations: i) that anaesthetists should consider obstetric cases as having a high risk of awareness and include the risk of awareness in the consenting pro- cess; ii) that the risk of awareness might be reduced by giving larger doses of induction agent, turning on the volatile agent early (and giving uterotonics to allow plenty to be used) and using nitrous oxide and opioids; iii) that an additional syringe of induction agent should be available to maintain anaesthesia in case of airway difficulties; iv) that failed regional anaesthesia was an additional risk factor (this occurred in four cases); and v) that the presence of a syringe of antibiotic at induction risked a syringe swap and awareness (one case). None of these recommendations are particularly contentious, except possibly the inclusion of awareness during consent. This is potentially fraught with difficulties, relating to whether and how to include a discussion of awareness in the pre-operative discussion, in what may be an urgent, time-constrained situation. The chapter hints at issues with thiopental, including the unfamiliarity of it amongst trainees and the risk of mistaking it for antibiotic, but doesn’t go as far as suggesting it should no longer be used in obstetrics, though that suggestion has been put forward elsewhere – of which more later.\\nMaternal mortality: moody skies\\u2028The MBRRACE-UK report was published in December 2014, with a new name reflecting a new approach. While the quantitative aspects of the Enquiries are important, there is greater emphasis than previous reports on the qualitative aspects. This is particularly\\nrelevant for the anaesthetic chapter, which has been discussed by Bamber and Kinsella. Two maternal deaths that were directly attributed to anaesthesia were related to general anaesthesia. In each case, several factors were identified that contributed to a poor outcome, with the major lessons specifically focusing on human factors though not specifically on the use of thiopental. However, the report also commented on the find- ing that' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' in some deaths, the dose of thiopental (and occasionally, propofol) used for induction of anaesthesia in severely ill women (e.g. those with septic or haemorrhagic shock) seemed excessive. Whilst this could reflect poor recognition of the severely ill parturient, this finding does serve to highlight once again the increasing unfamiliarity of anaesthetists with thiopental, and the chapter questions the place of thiopental as the anaesthetic induction agent of choice in obstetrics.\\nThe long-range forecast: what next for obstetric general anaesthesia?\\u2028The use of thiopental in obstetric anaesthesia was first described by Hamer Hodges in 1959 with a technique based solely on thiopental, suxamethonium, oxygen and nitrous oxide. Cricoid pressure was first described in 1961 and the traditional rapid sequence induction by Stept and Safar in 1970. In 1969, Wilson and Turner unsurprisingly recorded that with the original ‘Hamer Hodges’ technique, 17% of patients had ‘unpleasant recall’. Shortly after this, Moir demonstrated that the incidence of awareness could be reduced to less than 1% by the addition of halothane. With the exception of the evolution of volatile agents, there has been almost no change in technique since this time, with a general anaesthetic for caesarean section given in 2014 almost identical to that given in 1970. Both the NAP5 report and the MBRRACE-UK report question certain aspects of this technique and we would go a step further: it is time to replace thiopental with propofol for caesarean section.\\nIt would be unfair to blame all the adverse events described in the two reports on thiopental, which has served us so well for so long, but we believe that the tipping point predicted by Rucklidge in his elegant summary of the pros and cons of thiopental in obstetrics\\u2006 \\u2006 has now been reached.\\nSome of the problems with thiopental ought to be surmountable: we can teach our trainees better; and we can mix it more safely – though the risk of drug error will always remain. Other issues, such as availability and cost, are outside our control. (Of course, similar problems with availability may yet arise with propofol, which has already suffered a shortage particularly in the USA). And we now have the challenge of teaching a new generation how to give propofol safely and effectively in obstetrics. At this juncture, it might also be the time to reconsider the way in which the induction agent (propofol or otherwise) is given, e.g. by titrated/repeated bolus(es) as opposed to a single, pre-calculated dose.\\nWhat about other aspects of obstetric general anaesthesia? Encouraging more effective use of inhalational agents and better management of airway difficulties (including consideration of further induction agent) and of regional anaesthesia (especially failed) is really nothing new, and should not change the thrust of what we are already doing. Other potential changes still linger in the back- ground: opioids are more likely to be omitted from rapid sequence induction for obstetrics than in other settings, because of concerns about the fetus and the ability to wake a woman in the event of failed intubation, but these concerns have no evidence base. The choice of neuromuscular blocking drug to enable intubation, potentially switching from suxamethonium to rocuronium, is also a question yet to be decided. These too are not new suggestions, though the pro/con arguments are perhaps not as strong as they now are for thiopental/propofol. Giving opioids during induction of anaesthesia should already be familiar to all trainees and so it could be less of an about-turn to make this change than to stop using thiopental. However, although trainees are familiar with the use of non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs to facilitate intubation, a recommendation to switch from suxamethonium to rocuronium in the obstetric context is likely to be more controversial.\\nIs it still justifiable to continue to use a technique for obstetric general anaesthesia that is sixty years old, if there are (possibly better) alternatives? If not, how should be we conducting general anaesthesia for caesarean section? The case for the continued use of thiopental as the induction agent of choice in obstetric general anaesthesia has been greatly diminished, and we predict a change to propofol. Other components of the obstetric rapid sequence induction, while not so sacred, are also likely to change as we advance further into the 21st century. Central neuraxial blockade is established as the optimal technique' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' for obstetric anaesthesia, and research has largely been focused on this strategy. However, in doing so, general anaesthesia in obstetrics has perhaps been neglected. Recommendations from the NAP5 report point to a need to reinvigorate research in this area, and we would support this. Suggestions from the report include studies into: the appropriate dose and method of delivery of propofol in obstetrics, and the effect on the compromised mother and fetus; the safe minimum inspired oxygen fraction during general anaesthesia for caesarean section (especially with fetal compromise) to enable guidance on the use of nitrous oxide; the maintenance of uterine tone in the presence of high concentrations of volatile agent; the optimal timing and dosing of opioids during caesarean section; and the ‘true’ incidence of (and factors influencing the reporting of) awareness in obstetrics. In order to predict the weather, one first needs to gather data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ufeffFrom Hypnos to Ephialtes: waking up to the consequences of accidental awareness during obstetric general anaesthesia:\\nAccidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA), which is approximately 10-fold more common during caesarean birth than during most other types of surgery (5th UK National Audit Project – NAP5), can be a devastating event. The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial, including: a harried environment due to time pressure to achieve operative fetal delivery; provider distraction and anxiety due to the compelling need to multitask; an increased risk of difficulty with management of the obstetric airway; and adjustments made to anaesthetic techniques with the intention of minimising fetal exposure to sedative drugs. Although many studies have highlighted the problem of AAGA during general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery, the study by Odor et al. in this issue of Anaesthesia provides fresh perspectives and extensive insights from the largest, prospective cohort in this setting.\\nWhat distinguishes their study from previous cohort studies is not only the large sample size but also the rigorous ascertainment process to confirm the presence of AAGA (three Brice questionnaire screening interviews over a 1- month period, followed by robust adjudication). The authors estimated that approximately 1:200 (12 of 3115) patients undergoing caesarean delivery had experienced AAGA, which represents a three-fold higher rate than the self-reported rate by obstetric patients in the NAP5 study, and a comparable incidence to that reported by Paech et al. in 2008. We believe that the apparently higher incidence of AAGA reported in this study is a reflection of the sensitivity of the assessment techniques, rather than a true increase. Approximately 75% of the cases considered to be likely or probably AAGA occurred during the dynamic phases of anaesthesia; that is, during induction or emergence. A major strength of the study was the 12-month assessment period used to identify post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following AAGA. One third of patients who experienced AAGA met the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, giving a 42-fold increase in the odds for PTSD compared with non- AAGA controls. Considering these findings, a larger, international trial might appear to be the next logical step. However, it is probably not warranted due to a likely low reward-risk ratio because of: the expense and the logistics associated with such trials; the possibility of no additional insights; and the introduction of confounding associated with the cultural context (e.g. more heterogeneous methods of general anaesthesia and different degrees of patient concern about AAGA). Having been convinced by the scale of the study and the robust assessment of outcomes, we are of the opinion that any further investigation in this setting should focus on the impact of practice changes on AAGA rather than re-measuring the problem.\\nNevertheless, the rich data allow us to gain some valuable insights. At least some factors known to increase the risk of AAGA, such as inexperienced anaesthetists and the urgent nature of surgery, were, surprisingly, not clearly associated with AAGA in this cohort. For example, two-thirds of all reported cases of AAGA occurred with experienced anaesthesia providers (specialist registrar, staff grade or consultant). However, this observation is counterbalanced by the fact that more junior trainees performed fewer anaesthetics overall, with the rate of AAGA still considerably higher (approximately 1:150 patients) compared with experienced anaesthesia providers. Similarly, only 3 out of 12 cases of AAGA occurred during an emergency category-1 caesarean delivery. On the other hand, 83% of AAGA cases were anaesthetised after-hours between 20.00 and 08.00. Rather than the experience level of the anaesthetist or the urgency of delivering ana' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text='esthesia, this begs the question as to the contribution of fatigue, cognitive impairment, and perhaps the quality of the available assistance. This line of thought is supported by a few observations: four women with AAGA had received either a lower than recommended dose of intravenous anaesthetic (thiopentone < 5 mg.kg-1, propofol < 2 mg.kg-1) or ketamine, an agent that is less conducive for inducing rapid loss of consciousness; in two patients, there appeared to have been a delay in administering a second dose of hypnotic agent in the setting of prolonged attempts at intubation (along with the delay in initiation of inhalational anaesthesia); one patient received rocuronium but was awoken when inadequately reversed by neostigmine (in the absence of neuromuscular block monitoring); and three patients received less than one minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalational anaesthetic (0.8–0.9 MAC) during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia. In hindsight, using the recommended doses of anaesthetic drugs and appropriate monitoring of neuromuscular block might have prevented more than 70% of these cases of AAGA. Of note, midazolam, a benzodiazepine associated with anterograde amnesia [6], did not appear to have been used in any of the confirmed cases of AAGA.\\nChanging practice:\\nPractice changes in the management of general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery were suggested 5 years ago following the NAP5 study, yet these appear to have been largely ignored. Based on the information detailed by Odor et al., some of the solutions to the problem of AAGA in the obstetric setting require further investigation but appear potentially straightforward, pragmatic, and achievable. The first is to identify the anaesthetic induction agent, or combination thereof, that is least likely to be associated with AAGA and to determine the appropriate dose. Considering the over-representation of thiopentone use among AAGA cases in NAP5, lack of significant differences in neonatal outcomes between either thiopentone and propofol, and evidence for better electro-encephalographic (EEG) suppression with propofol in this setting, the case for advocating propofol (at a dose of ≥ 2.5 mg.kg-1) as the intravenous anaesthetic induction drug of choice in haemodynamically stable patients continues to build. Second, allowing an entire minute to ensure adequate neuromuscular block after succinylcholine (suxamethonium) or rocuronium 1 mg.kg-1, compared with laryngoscopy earlier, is likely to ensure optimal intubating conditions, an unconscious patient before the first intubation attempt, and possibly a slightly longer interval before surgical incision. Third, to bridge across the intravenous to inhalational anaesthesia interval, an overpressure technique, dialling in a higher than target concentration of inhalational agent under high gas flow, can be used to achieve an adequate effect-site concentration of inhalational anaesthetic. This takes approximately 2–2.5 min for sevoflurane in non- pregnant subjects but is likely to be shorter in pregnant women. Although the lower MAC of inhalational agents during pregnancy is often used as a justification to deliver less inhalational anaesthetic, we posit a few reasons why this may be an erroneous assumption: most studies were done between 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy and not at advanced gestation; the sensitivity of the brain to volatile anaesthetic at term gestation appears to be similar to non- pregnant controls ; and catecholamines, which are aplenty during urgent caesarean delivery and are known to enhance arousal, are likely to increase the MAC of inhalational agents. Therefore, a 1-MAC target for maintenance of anaesthesia seems reasonable and probably necessary. Given the profound psychological consequences of AAGA, the concern for uterine relaxation and atony, which is largely based on in-vitro studies, should be addressed with optimal uterotonic therapy rather than by decreasing the MAC of inhalational agent delivered. Should there be a need to decrease the MAC for such a reason, the administration of an amnesic agent such as midazolam or deepening the anaesthetic with propofol might prove to be sound practice. Additionally, given it is unlikely that AAGA will be entirely eliminated, if time permits, a brief discussion of the risk of AAGA should be included in the process of obtaining informed consent. Finally, a definitive process should be in place for the follow-up of patients who report AAGA. Although the Brice questionnaire is overly sensitive, often detecting post- recovery dreaming and other non-AAGA events, it is reassuring to know that the first screening interview in the DREAMY study captured' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' 11 of 12 likely or probable cases of AAGA. Patients who screen positive at the Brice questionnaire can then be subjected to a more detailed adjudication interview.\\nControversies:\\nThere are a number of controversies regarding optimal intra-operative management, specific to emergency caesarean delivery and the risk of AAGA, which need to be addressed.\\nPre-delivery opioids are often avoided because of concern about neonatal respiratory depression, although after alfentanil (7.5–10 lg.kg-1) and remifentanil (1 lg.kg-1 bolus) 5-min Apgar scores are not significantly impacted, presumably due to rapid drug clearance. However, equipoise remains with respect to the possible fetal effects of fentanyl. If a pre-filled remifentanil syringe is readily available it might be useful, for example, to obtund the intubation response in maternal hypertensive disease, with mitigation of potentially serious adverse maternal outcomes more important than minor fetal effects. Opioids are effective sympatholytic agents that mitigate the arousal effects of nociception, decrease the MAC of inhalational agents, and reduce the sympathetic response to endotracheal intubation and surgical incision. We favour the use of pre-delivery opioids for these reasons but recommend that the doses of anaesthetic induction agents not be reduced in order to minimise the risk of widening of the intravenous to inhalational anaesthesia interval.\\nSimilarly, the use of pre-delivery nitrous oxide is controversial for a variety of reasons, including concern about fetal neurotoxicity and the presumed, but unproven, benefit of administering 100% oxygen. Because of the short duration of exposure during emergency caesarean delivery, the developmental neurotoxic effect of nitrous oxide appears to be a moot concern. Use of 100% oxygen is associated with a significant increase in fetal oxygenation, although its impact on neonatal outcomes remains questionable. In non-emergency settings in which 100% oxygen may not be necessary, nitrous oxide can facilitate the overpressure technique via the second gas effect, and after delivery in the setting of obstetric haemorrhage, can reduce the inhalational anaesthetic concentration required.\\nA third area of controversy surrounds the use of non- depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs, especially as neuromuscular block is considered an independent risk-factor for AAGA. Rocuronium is now an alternative option to succinylcholine during rapid sequence induction, and if used, it should be accompanied by monitoring of neuromuscular recovery. Although unexpected suxamethonium apnoea is very uncommon, it was noted to be a contributing factor in one instance of AAGA in this cohort. Therefore, even when suxamethonium is used as the sole neuromuscular blocking agent, confirming optimal recovery of neuromuscular function before weaning of the inhalational agent is essential and consistent with good practice. In one of the editorialist’s institutions, non- depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs are rarely used and although this occasionally causes minor surgical inconvenience, the anaesthetist is able to quickly identify signs of light anaesthesia (patient-ventilator dyssynchrony or movement) and initiate an intervention (e.g. increasing the volatile anaesthetic concentration or administering an opioid, midazolam, or propofol).\\nFinally, the use of ‘depth-of-anaesthesia’ processed EEG monitors in this setting is also controversial. Despite the low priority for applying these monitors during emergency caesarean delivery, there could be potential benefits. Had one of these monitors been used in > 4.7% of the patients in the study by Odor et al., for example, there was the potential to add another layer for the detection of inadequate anaesthetic depth in 10 of the 12 cases. Confirming index values ≤ 40 before intubation (when end-tidal anaesthetic concentration monitoring may not be available) and before surgical incision would indicate a very low probability of AAGA in the circumstances of intravenous anaesthetic under-dosing, delay in delivery of inhaled anaesthetic, a syringe swap or failure of drug-delivery equipment. While neither of the latter two circumstances applied to a case of AAGA in the study by Odor et al., both have been noted to be relevant causes. Because of the wide inter-patient variability in the relationship between end-tidal inhalational anaesthetic concentration and bispectral index values, and the yet unknown relationship between these two variables in the high catecholamine state of pregnant women under extreme stress, a processed EEG monitor, for all its shortcomings, could provide valuable information during the maintenance and arousal phases. We see no downsides to applying such' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' a monitor if there is no time pressure.\\nConsequences\\nThe most significant contribution made by this study is, in our opinion, confirmation of the association between AAGA and subsequent PTSD in this unique baseline characteristic. The incidence of PTSD reported in this study is broadly consistent with previous reports in other patient populations. Unlike other patients, however, the effect of PTSD is not just limited to the mother but also extends to her offspring; post-partum PTSD is associated with failed initiation of breastfeeding, a negative impact on the social-emotional development of children at 2 years of age, and arguably, impaired maternal-infant bonding. Therefore, early recognition of AAGA and subsequent intervention is paramount to minimising the long-term consequences for the mother-infant dyad. Attention is required not just to initial full disclosure and counselling but also to regular review and support.\\nIn summary, considering the common and profound psychological sequelae that may accompany AAGA during caesarean birth, two critical but common sense messages stand out. Elimination of AAGA should be an aspirational goal, supported by investigation of the relevant outcomes associated with changes to anaesthetic techniques and the encouragement of compliance with recommended monitoring; and patients experiencing AAGA should undergo comprehensive follow-up for symptoms and signs of PTSD so that appropriate referral to mental health services can be organised.\\n\\n\\n \\ufeffDelirium in patients following general anaesthesia:\\n\\nDelirium is a disturbance of consciousness characterised\\nby an acute onset and fluctuating course of inattention,\\naccompanied by either a change in cognition or a\\ndisorganised thinking, resulting in an impaired ability\\nof the patient to receive, process, store and recall\\ninformation. Delirium develops over a short period of\\ntime (hours to days) and is usually reversible. Three\\nsubtypes have been described: hypoactive, hyperactive\\nand mixed delirium. Mixed and hypoactive delirium\\nare the most common subtypes and are often\\nundiagnosed if routine screening is not implemented.\\nThe prevalence of delirium in the community is low\\nbut can go up to 70% in frail elderly patients undergoing\\nemergency hip fracture surgery in the postoperative\\nperiod. This increased healthcare burden has profound\\nimplications on a rapidly ageing population.\\nPostoperative delirium comes at a significant cost\\nto both patients and healthcare systems in general.\\nThe patient with postoperative delirium may suffer\\nincreased mortality, length of hospital stay, long-term\\ncognitive impairment and functional decline, and need for\\ndischarge to a long-term care facility.\\nRisk factors for delirium include patient factors\\nsuch as advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities such\\nas dementia or cognitive impairment, and a poor\\nfunctional baseline. Emergency, complex or major\\nabdominopelvic surgery similarly increases the risk\\nof postoperative delirium. Other preoperative triggers\\nfor delirium may include polypharmacy, pain, sleep\\ndeprivation, and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.\\nPost-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) delirium is a\\nsubset of perioperative delirium. The difference between\\nPACU and postoperative delirium lies primarily in\\nthe definition of the timeframe used, with the former\\noccurring in the PACU on the day of surgery while\\nthe latter occurring after surgery. This definition can\\ncomplicate matters as PACU delirium consists of an\\ninseparable combination of emergence delirium/agitation\\nand postoperative delirium. Emergence agitation refers\\nto restlessness, disorientation, excitation, non-purposeful\\nmovement, thrashing, and incoherence during the early\\nrecovery from general anaesthesia. It is classically short-\\nlived, resolves spontaneously and has minimal long-term\\nsequelae. That being said, the presence of emergence\\nagitation remains a strong predictor of postoperative\\ndelirium.\\nAlthough PACU delirium carries an association with\\nsubsequent postoperative delirium, it remains to be\\nseen whether the former has associations with long-term\\nmorbidity and mortality that are similar to postoperative\\ndelirium. A study on the long-term outcomes of PACU\\ndelirium in elderly patients failed to demonstrate any\\ncorrelation with mortality, mental or physical function,\\nand utilisation of healthcare resources 18 months\\nfollowing general anaesthesia. Further studies will\\nbe required to determine the long-term significance of\\nPACU delirium in perioperative patient care.\\nThere is an even greater paucity of literature on\\nPACU delirium in the Asian population.

This is similar to\\ninternational data, where a study by Hernandez et al.\\ninvolving more than 7,000 patients found that the mean\\nincidence of PACU delirium was 16.4%.\\nPreviously identified risk factors for PACU delirium\\ninclude advanced age, longer preoperative fasting times,\\nmale, type of surgery, higher American Society of\\nAnaesthesiologists (ASA) scores, type of perioperative\\ndrugs administered (such as benzodiazepines, volatile\\nanaesthetics or opioids) and the volume of packed red\\ncells or fresh frozen plasma given.

Furthermore, in contrast to the article by\\nHernandez, the authors did not find any significant\\ncorrelation between the type of anaesthesia used, the\\ndrugs administered, and the depth of anaesthesia with the\\nincidence of PACU delirium.

In contrast, the Electroencephalography\\nGuidance of Anesthesia (ENGAGES) trial was a\\nrandomised controlled trial that demonstrated no\\ndifference in delirium rates when electroencephalography\\nwas used to guide anaesthesia.\\nInterestingly, Ke et al. found on multivariate analysis\\nthat higher random blood glucose (>9.5mmol/L) was\\npositively associated with PACU delirium. This is an\\neasily modifiable factor that may potentially help to\\nreduce any morbidity linked to delirium. The presence\\nand duration of intraoperative hyperglycaemia (blood\\nglucose >8.3mmol/L) has previously been found to have\\na significant association with postoperative delirium\\n(odds ratio 3.86 confidence interval [CI] 95% [1.13–\\n39.49], P=0.044). However, excessively tight control\\nof glucose levels (4.4–8.3mmol/L) may also be\\ndetrimental as the risk of delirium increases (relative\\nrisk 1.89, 95% CI 1.06–3.37, P=0.03).13 It is important\\nto avoid hypoglycaemia and therefore more liberal\\nglycaemic control may be preferred in the perioperative\\nsetting (similar to protocols commonly used in intensive\\ncare units).

With a balanced and rational use of drug profiles, general anaesthesia allows even frail and very ill patients a margin of tolerability inconceivable just a few years ago. For the vast majority of patients, the risk from the general anaesthetic technique is so small it can be considered negligible. However, the majority of general anaesthetic drugs are both highly potent and very toxic, with many of the volatile agents still having a therapeutic ratio of about 4 : 1. The anaesthetic staff have to continually upgrade their skills and knowledge to ensure that harm does not result. It is, however, reasonable to offer some practical guidelines from the current literature on when to choose a general anaesthetic technique, either alone or with a regional local anaesthetic method, and when to avoid loss of consciousness. The complications expected from the use of general anaesthesia are reviewed, and the basis for these complications investigated. The currently available drugs and their place in anaesthetic practice are also assessed. Recent developments in the area of total intravenous anaesthesia and monitoring for potential awareness using bispectral analysis suggest that this technique should now be included in the choice of anaesthetic. Recommendations are made on both the selection of the technique, and the appropriate agents for a given group of patients.\\nIntroduction: General anaesthesia and its usage vary across national boundaries in response to such wide influences as social acceptability, availability of skilled anaesthetic staff and financial constraints. General anaesthesia can be defined as the use of one or more potent drugs to achieve a state where there is loss of consciousness, immobility and analgesia in a patient undergoing surgery. It may be combined with ‘local anaesthesia’ where nerve conduction blockade limits the transmission of painful stimuli from the site of surgery to the central nervous system. However, the key features of general anaesthesia are loss of consciousness and a reduction in autonomic control systems. This state is reversible and largely predictable across patients. Recent developments in the drugs available for use in general anaesthesia, and more detailed trials on the role of anaesthetic technique on outcome, have made it timely to review the status of ‘general anaesthesia’ again\\u2006 \\u2006 and to try to offer some practical recommendations on its current role in anaesthesia as a whole. General anaesthesia often has unfounded but frightening associations in the minds of patients and many doctors; of awareness during surgery, of failure to recover completely and of loss of autonomy. Indeed, for many years, there has been' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' widespread publicity surrounding cases of painful aware- ness during surgery, of postoperative mental failure and of death. There have been many studies within the anaesthetic literature trying to explain the causes for some of these complications, yet there is very little consensus from the results. There are firmly held beliefs on the merits or otherwise of general anaesthesia, especially in the elderly, and these must be reviewed briefly to place general anaesthesia in its appropriate context. Data from France demonstrate that there is an excess of cognitive decline in surgical patients compared with an age-matched group, and a European multi- centre trial has confirmed that general anaesthesia is associated with more cognitive changes with increasing age of the patient.There are several other factors that influence the choice of agent or technique, and these include the detailed assessment of the functional status of the patient, the expected surgical procedure and finally, the location of the procedure. The implementation of these recommendations depends on the availability of sufficient resources to allow the anaesthetist a real choice between techniques and drugs. Worldwide, this may limit the utility of this review depending on the country concerned.\\n\\nSpecific complications of General Anaesthesia: The solution to more than 200 years of research into how general anaesthetics work finally appears to be closer to resolution. It seems that anaesthesia is probably achieved by drug effects at both voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels; intra- cellular sites such as protein kinase C and phospholipase A2.\\nRegardless of the route of administration chosen, general anaesthetic drugs have to cross the blood- brain barrier to achieve their effect. The most com- mon routes are intravenous and inhalational, and only rarely are the enteral or transcutaneous routes chosen. The intravenous and inhalational routes depend on the maintenance of an adequate cardiac output to deliver the drugs to the brain. Any reduction in either peripheral circulation or pulmonary function, respectively will limit the efficiency of drug delivery.\\nFollowing administration of these drugs they may pass through several organ systems before reaching the systemic circulation and hence the brain. All the organs involved may be affected by, or alter, the drugs. For intravenously administered drugs, the first active organ encountered will be the lung where significant first pass metabolism may occur. For volatile anaesthetics, and the intra- venous drugs after the pulmonary circulation, the myocardium is the next critical organ. Depression of either conduction or contractility will reduce cardiac output, and transfer of drug to the brain. The resulting fall in cardiac output will also affect perfusion-dependent organ systems such as the kidneys, brain and liver. These effects occur on the initial administration of the drugs before they reach the brainstem where they may also cause autonomic depression. Once in the systemic circulation they may also have direct effects on the peripheral vasculature leading to alterations in muscular tone and further changes in organ perfusion.\\nThe changes that occur once the drugs pass the blood-brain barrier depend on several factors. One\\nof the first is a change from the awake behavioural control from cortical and other higher centres of the autonomic nervous system to a purely brain stem reflex control. There is inevitably a period of instability as the transition occurs, and there may be profound alterations in the essential control of cardiac output leading to hypotension, or of the airway muscles leading to airway collapse and obstruction. Uncoupling of brain stem reflexes may occur, for instance, a reduction in the baroreceptor/ hypotension responses may lead to profound hypotension and bradycardia. Changes in the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching will lead to alterations in pulmonary shunt with the risk of hypoxia.\\nOther immediate problems may relate to true hypersensitivity to the anaesthetic agents used. This is much more common with the intra- venous anaesthetic agents than the volatile anaesthetics, but is still rare. It is, however, a potentially lethal reaction and must influence the choice of technique.\\nThere are also patients who have genetic abnormalities which make them much more sensitive to the otherwise normal action of these ‘anaesthetic drugs’. Two of the most common disorders are the reduction in plasma cholinesterase activity seen in patients sensitive to suxamethonium, the depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent, and the sensitivity of some patients’ intracellular calcium metabolism to general anaesthetics leading to an uncoupling of sarcolemmal function. This causes excessive release of calcium and a reduced uptake leading to hypermetabolic activity. This, in turn, leads to the syndrome of malignant hyperpyrexia and may be caused by the substitution of cysteine for arginine 614 (Arg614Cys) in the human ryanodine receptor gene. \\nThese occur following general anaesthesia, and are usually the result of an interaction between the drugs and the patient.' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' They may occur within hours of the patient leaving the recovery area, or after several days (or nights). Some of these problems appear to have a cause beyond simple drug interaction. Metabolic consequences of anaesthesia, such as the effect of certain volatile anaesthetic agents (halothane and chloroform) on the liver, have been known for years. The extent and severity of damage is related to both the route of metabolism of the volatile agent and the reductive state of the hepatic enzymes during anaesthesia. The effects are cumulative, and repetitive exposure greatly increases the risk of a life-threatening hepatitis.\\nChanges in cardiac output may affect the re- distribution of potent drugs such as the nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking agents, and occasionally result in prolonged paralysis despite apparently adequate reversal with antagonist drugs. A reduction in cardiac output will slow down the delivery of volatile anaesthetic agents back into the pulmonary circulation and prolong the process of their subsequent elimination.\\nThere has been concern that general anaesthesia is specifically associated with prolonged, if not permanent, cognitive changes, especially in the elderly. These effects have been debated since the early 1950s[11] and have been the subject of several studies, both small and large. The fact that cognitive deficit following surgery exists, and is quite common, is now proven beyond doubt, but the causes remain as inscrutable as ever. The largest studies to date have failed to show any greater\\nadverse effect of general anaesthesia, compared with local anaesthesia for instance, on outcome. Smaller studies have been reported where the ad- vantages between general and local anaesthesia were more clear cut, but there have been unjustified recommendations made on the basis of these small samples of the population. Duration of exposure to anaesthesia has also been identified in some studies\\u2006 \\u2006 as a predictor of a poorer outcome in the elderly. However, whether this is caused by the complexity of the surgery or the duration of anaesthesia is unclear.\\nThese data, while interesting, are now largely historical for many reasons. Cohorts of the elderly have changed over time with increasingly better social conditions and improved healthcare, reducing the burden of damage caused by infections and malnutrition. Furthermore, advances have been made over the last 5 years in both the monitoring of and better tolerability of novel anaesthetic agents. Integrated anaesthetic machines where both the patient’s physiological variables, and the anaesthetic machine functions, can be monitored in real time now allow a degree of control which was impossible just a few years ago. This, combined with advances in the theoretical basis of drug delivery, its modelling and computer software development, has provided anaesthetists with the opportunity to rationalise their choices not only between local or general anaesthesia, but also between different techniques of general anaesthesia. International drives to participate in continuing medical education has allowed these developments to spread more rapidly, and yet safely, into routine practice rather than remaining as specialised techniques only available in teaching hospitals.\\nThere are clinical areas of anaesthetic practice where there are clear indications of benefit of one system of anaesthesia over another, such as the cur- rent use of regional local anaesthesia in operative obstetric care instead of the more traditional general anaesthesia-based care. Equally, there are specific areas of surgery where the reverse is true, and where general anaesthesia offers the only real technique to allow successful surgery, such as laparoscopic upper abdominal surgery. The increasing use of day care surgery, where a rapid return to normal function is essential, has also focused attention on the role of anaesthetic techniques in the recovery of these patients. Increasingly complex surgery is being undertaken, on increasingly less fit patients and the burden of their care is rest- ing with primary care physicians. The use of short-acting anaesthetic drugs, with rapid elimination kinetics, has greatly improved the likelihood of surgical success.\\nSpecific Anaesthetic drugs: Two volatile anaesthetic agents have been made available since the last review 5 years ago: desflurane and sevoflurane. These agents are much more lipid insoluble than the previously available agents in common usage (isoflurane, enflurane and halothane) and, therefore, produce a predictably more rapid induction and recovery. They have individual properties that have marked influences on their clinical usage. Desflurane (difluoromethyl 1-fluoro-2,2,2-tri- fluoroethyl ether) is both nonflammable, and non- corrosive to metals. It is stable in carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbers and is only of limited solubility in rubber and plastics. Desflurane has a vapour pressure of 664mm Hg at 20°C, and a special heated vaporiser is used to generate pure desflurane at twice atmospheric pressure. This vapour is then diluted with the anaesthetic carrier gases' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' for clinical use. The substitution of the chlorine for fluorine in isoflurane to produce desflurane dramatically reduces the blood/gas partition coefficient to 0.45, which is nearly as low as nitrous oxide, but it also greatly reduces the potency of desflurane. Its minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), a guide to relative potency, is 6.0%. Unfortunately, inhaled concentrations greater than the MAC can cause irritation, with coughing, breath holding or laryngospasm, and this makes induction of anaesthesia with desflurane very difficult in practice. If induction is achieved intravenously, introduction of desflurane is then rapidly effective because of the fast equilibration between inspired alveolar concentrations and those in the brain; 80% equilibration occurring within 5 minutes. Recovery, even after prolonged administration, is equally rapid.\\nThe physiological effects of desflurane are similar to isoflurane, and blood pressure decreases in a dose-dependent manner, while cardiac output is preserved. These changes are largely caused by a fall in systemic resistance unless excessive concentrations are administered. There are transient increases in catecholamine levels with rapid alterations in desflurane concentrations but these do not appear to cause clinically significant problems, and there is conflicting evidence regarding the existence of clinically significant coronary ischaemia.\\nDesflurane is a potent ventilatory depressant. The CO2 concentration increases and at a concentration above 10 to 12%, apnoea is likely. It has similar effects to other halogenated anaesthetics on the cerebral circulation, and autoregulation is maintained, but there is an increase in intracranial pressure. Splanchnic blood flow is maintained which preserves hepatic and renal function. There is very little metabolism of desflurane, with only 0.002% of the inhaled dose being recovered as metabolic breakdown products. Importantly, there is evidence that desflurane should not be used in circle systems where the CO2 absorbent has dried out. There have been cases where carboxy- haemoglobin formation has occurred in this situation. Drying, however, is only likely if the system is left with fresh gas flowing for several hours.\\nThe anaesthetic disadvantages of the airway irritability caused by desflurane are offset by the rapid recovery profile even after very prolonged anaesthesia. The very low solubility in fatty tissue and the minimal metabolism make this an ideal agent for prolonged surgery. It has also been extensively used in day care surgery because of its rapid equilibration on induction, and the benefit of a rapid recovery profile, although this may be an expensive method of anaesthesia because of the high gas flows commonly used in such short procedures. The high cost of this agent can be limited if it is used in either a closed or very low flow circle system.\\nSevoflurane (fluoromethyl 2,2,2-trifluoro-1- trifluoromethyl ethyl ether) is similar to desflurane in that it is also nonflammable. It also has a low blood/gas partition coefficient (0.65) but is much more potent than desflurane with a MAC of 2%. It has a saturated vapour pressure of 160mm Hg, and can be administered from a standard plenum type vaporiser.\\nIts physiological effects are similar to those of desflurane with the exception of a greater degree of cardiovascular stability with increasing concentration. It is not associated with the catecholamine release seen with sudden changes in desflurane concentrations, and theoretically may be considered to be preferable in the high-risk noncardiac surgical patient with severe ischaemic heart disease. It has the same profile of action on the cerebrovascular system, and again causes increases in intracranial pressure above 0.5 MAC.\\nIt is metabolised more extensively than desflurane (3% of the inspired vapour is metabolised largely to hexafluoroisopropanol) and there has been concern about the level of fluoride produced. However, several studies\\u2006 \\u2006 have shown little clinical significance concerning fluoride production. Degradation of sevoflurane by CO2 absorbents, especially baralyme, with the production of ‘compound A’ [CF2 = C(CF3)-O-CH2F] has also caused concern. Compound A is an olefin, and these compounds have caused nephrotoxicity in rats. Production of compound A may be increased during low flow (<1 L/min fresh gas flow) because of an increase in the temperature of the CO2 absorbent, and during very prolonged administration (6 to 10 hours). It is likely that it is the cumulative dose that is important,' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' and the use of the ‘area under the curve’ method of calculating this may be helpful. Currently, these concerns appear to be largely theoretical, and clinical data confirming adverse effects are lacking.\\nThe clinical use of sevoflurane has become based on its excellent induction properties, largely as a result of its combination of high potency, low blood/gas solubility and lack of airway irritability. It is widely used for gaseous induction in both children and adults (where it has been used for single breath induction). The much more limited metabolism and current lack of evidence of a hepatotoxic reaction have led many anaesthetists to prefer its use for paediatric gaseous induction rather than halothane. It is, however, much more expensive, and with the wasteful high fresh gas flows necessary for a gas induction, it cannot be considered as the ideal gaseous induction agent. It has the same benefits for day care surgery as desflurane, and may prove to be as acceptable an anaesthetic agent in this population.\\nThe progressive difference between the recovery profiles of sevoflurane and desflurane with increasing duration of anaesthesia would suggest that for short procedures (between 30 and 60 minutes), the clinical advantages lie with sevoflurane. However, once the procedure extends for more than 1 hour, desflurane maintains its recovery profile far better than sevoflurane, and should be the agent of choice.\\nNitrous Oxide, the ‘grandfather’ of anaesthetic agents has been used since 1844, but its place as a routine adjuvant to general anaesthesia is becoming challenged. Its presence on anaesthetic machines demands the expensive provision of alarms and control systems to prevent the delivery of hypoxic gas mixtures, and yet it is the least potent of anaesthetics. It has limited effects on organ systems, partly because of its low rate of metabolism (0.004%), and partly because it is always given with other, more potent agents since its use as a sole anaesthetic agent is highly likely to result in awareness. Prolonged administration causes inactivation of methionine synthase, a cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12)-dependent enzyme. Inactivation of this enzyme causes interference with DNA synthesis and prevents the bone marrow production of both leucocytes and red blood cells. Megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow can follow oxidation of the cobalt atom in cyanocobalamin by nitrous oxide, and it has caused neuropathy in some experimental animals, although the clinical significance of these findings is unclear.\\nNitrous oxide will continue to be used as an analgesic agent for dental surgery and in obstetric practice but the routine administration of nitrous oxide for general anaesthesia is unlikely to extend far into the next millennium. It is used currently to limit the use of more potent volatile anaesthetic agents and to try to avoid the risk of awareness. Better availability of devices that can reliably indicate the lack of awareness will overcome many of these concerns, and bispectral analysis may prove to be one such device.\\nXenon has been investigated as an alternative gaseous inhalation anaesthetic over the years, but while it has been proved to be effective, and only moderately expensive, it has too few exceptional characteristics to commend as an alternative for routine anaesthetic use.\\nUntil recently, the agents available for the intra- venous induction of anaesthesia were either unsuitable, or difficult to use for the maintenance of anaesthesia. The introduction of propofol and the concurrent developments in the understanding of the action, kinetics and dynamics of intravenous anaesthetic drugs have allowed the generation of delivery systems for propofol, both for induction of anaesthesia and its maintenance. The place of total intravenous anaesthesia is becoming established, as are the specific indications for its preference over inhalational methods. Clinical trials with other new induction agents have also reduced the indications for barbiturate-based anaesthetic agents, such as thiopental (thiopentone), because the profile of adverse effects are much better with these newer agents, which often have a shorter duration of action.\\nPropofol became clinically available in the UK in 1989 and has been released worldwide since then. It has been extensively studied clinically and its advantages are well documented. It provides a pleasant gradual induction for the patient, with a lack of airway irritability. It has a very short duration of action and results in a very rapid recovery. Propofol is potent and has anti-emetic effects as well as anticonvulsant properties. It does, however, have a series of adverse effects that offset these advantages. These include both cardiovascular and respiratory depression, as well as pain on intravenous injection. The cardiovascular effects include marked bradycardia, and even asystole has been recorded. However,' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' the initial data on the cardiovascular effects of induction of anaesthesia with bolus injections of propofol were biased against the elderly patient, partly because of a poor study design (rapid repetition of bolus dosages against a clinical indicator of loss of consciousness with no regard to arm-brain circulation times).\\nMore recent work supports a fall in systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, with a resetting of the baroreceptor reflex, leading to significant hypotension, especially in patients with hypovolaemia. Slow rates of propofol infusion do not cause such obvious changes, although there are still significant falls in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance.\\nThe ventilatory effects of propofol include a significant fall in tidal and minute volumes, lead- ing to apnoea when an excessive dosage (>2.5 mg/kg) is administered. There are also reductions in both the hypercarbic and hypoxic ventilatory response curves. Propofol, at clinically used plasma concentrations, has an inhibitory action on drug metabolism. Although the increasing use of propofol as a sedative agent in intensive care settings has many positive characteristics (such as rapid recovery), this needs to be balanced against its excitatory activity seen in very ill children, where it may contribute to an increased mortality.\\n\\nOther newer induction agents have also been investigated in clinical trials, including corticosteroids such as eltanolone, (5β-pregnanolone), and the α2-adrenergic agonists such as dexmedetomidine, clonidine and azepexole. Specific enantiomers of existing anaesthetic drugs, such as ketamine, have also been assessed.\\nCorticosteroid-Based Anaesthetic Drugs\\nProgesterone and some of its derivatives have potent hypnotic activity because they are converted to 3α-OH,5α-pregnan-20-one in the brain. However, there are currently no well tolerated and effective agents that are likely to become clinically available from this family of drugs.\\nα2-Adrenergic Agonists\\nThe antihypertensive drug clonidine reduces the dose requirement for anaesthetic and analgesic drugs because of stimulation of central α2- adrenergic receptors. Oral clonidine administered 90 minutes before surgery, results in sedation and a reduction in anxiety. It lowers the anaesthetic dosage requirements of both inhalational anaesthetics and opiates.\\nFurther research has demonstrated that α2- adrenergic agonists not only markedly reduce the dose requirements of anaesthetic agents but also are capable of inducing anaesthesia themselves. Rapid intravenous infusion of these agents is associated with bradycardia and hypertension but these effects can be avoided by either a slow intravenous infusion or by intramuscular injection. These findings have led to a series of highly selective, centrally acting α2-adrenergic agonists being developed; 2 such drugs are dexmedetomidine and azepexole. Dexmedetomidine has been used in veterinary practice for some time but has marked motor activity on induction. It has been used clinically for pre-medication (as an injection of dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg/kg ) where it reduces the induction dose of anaesthetic drugs, but it also increases the incidence of hypotension. The drug has also been investigated as an intravenous anaesthetic agent but, as yet, has not demonstrated any clear advantages over current intravenous induction agents.\\nThe enantiomers of ketamine have been investigated for individual advantages over the racemic mixture. Whilst differences in potency and recovery can be identified, there are few clinical advantages over the original racemic ketamine. They are all associated with an equal incidence of dreaming on emergence from anaesthesia, although the dysphoric effects were less with the S-isomer.\\nNeuromuscular Junction Blocking Agents (Muscle Relaxants)\\nThere have been great changes in the availability of muscle relaxants over the last 5 years. Some of these drugs have broad clinical applications whereas others are of limited use. There is still the need for a very rapidly acting nondepolarising muscle relaxant, capable of rapid reversal and with no context sensitive half-life. While several drugs have moved some way towards that goal, there is still an uncontested place for the depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug suxamethonium chloride (suxamethonium). There is the possibility that rapacuronium bromide (rapacurium; Org-9487), currently under clinical investigation, may come close to meeting these requirements.\\n Specific Drugs\\nMivacurium chloride (mivacurium) is a modified benzylisoquinoline similar to atracurium besilate (atracurium), with an onset time of 2 to 3 minutes and' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' a brief duration of action. This short duration of action is useful for many operative procedures. Mivacurium provides 10 to 18 minutes of profound relaxation and, because it is broken down by plasma cholinesterase activity, there is also rapid spontaneous recovery. However, there have been reports of a prolongation of action in patients who have abnormalities of these enzymes. Mivacurium can cause histamine release, especially if injected rapidly, and it requires a high dose to produce satisfactory intubating conditions within a short time scale (less than 2 minutes).\\nCisatracurium Besilate\\nRefinement of the enantiomers of the benzyl- isoquinoline atracurium has led to the commercial availability of cisatracurium besilate (cisatracurium). Clinically, this has provided a cardio-stable, nonhistamine releasing, nondepolarising muscle relaxant that also undergoes both plasma esterase metabolism and Hofmann degradation. When incu- bated in human plasma cisatracurium degrades to form laudanosine, and significant amounts of the monoquaternary alcohol that also slowly degrades to laudanosine. The characteristics of cisatracurium include a slow onset of relaxation and an intermediate duration of action. It is highly potent and, because of its routes of metabolism, can be administered for prolonged periods with little change in its context sensitive (the context sensitive half-life describes the effect of accumulation of a drug within other tissues, such as fat, over time which then increases the time that the effect site concentration returns to sub-therapeutic levels). The more tissue deposition over time, the longer the recovery period will be) half-life. The drug is of great value in patients with poor cardiac output states, or if organic damage of the liver or kidneys is likely to be present. It does not cause histamine release from mast cells and this leads to marked cardiovascular stability compared with other relaxants.\\nRocuronium Bromide\\nThe development of a relatively potent but rap- idly acting nondepolarising relaxant that can replace suxamethonium has been awaited for some time and rocuronium bromide (rocuronium), a steroid-based relaxant, was hoped to be that agent. It has a rapid onset of action, with times to safe intubation of under 1 minute [especially in high dose ranges (1.2 mg/kg)], but with a prolonged du- ration of action of up to 90 minutes. It is partly metabolised by the liver and has a longer, but unpredictable, half-life in patients with cirrhosis. This is because of a larger volume of distribution and lower clearance. Rocuronium is cardio-stable,\\nwith little ganglionic activity but its place as an alternative to suxamethonium is restricted by its duration of activity.\\nOther New Relaxants\\nPipecuronium bromide, a steroid-based relax- ant, and doxacurium chloride, a benzylisoquinoline- based relaxant, are 2 other nondepolarising neuromuscular blocking agents that have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system. However, their long duration of action (up to 120 minutes) and variable onset time of 2 to 6 minutes limit their usefulness. The development of both cisatracurium and rocuronium make the clinical need for either pipecuronium or doxacurium questionable.\\nOpioid Analgesic Drugs\\nBolus injections or infusions of opiates to provide analgesia and an anaesthetic-sparing effect have been used for many years, but the introduction of a novel opioid with esterase breakdown (remifentanil), has revolutionised the tolerability of this technique. Remifentanil has an ester structure and is very rapidly metabolised by blood and tissue esterases. It is highly potent, and clinical studies have shown only a very limited accumulation of the drug. This very flat context-sensitive half-life allows remifentanil to be used for procedures of varying length while maintaining a predictable recovery profile.\\nRemifentanil is cardio-stable and has limited toxicity in high dosage. The lack of accumulation of remifentanil, even after prolonged administration at high concentrations,\\u2006 \\u2006 allows the clinician to rapidly titrate the concentration of analgesic to the surgical stimulus rather than trying to increase the concentration of the anaesthetic agent itself. This flexibility in being able to swiftly reduce the concentration as well as to raise it, is the major advantage of remifentanil. The use of this agent with the intravenous anaesthetic propofol has been demonstrated to reduce the propofol concentration necessary for anaesthesia by up to 75%.\\nRem' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text='ifentanil is not without its drawbacks however, and if given prior to the induction of anaesthesia is associated with marked muscle rigidity and apnoea. These effects are both rapid and severe, and can occur in the recovery or post- anaesthetic care unit if the cannula used for its administration has not been flushed through per- operatively. Extreme caution is necessary to avoid these complications. There are currently no data on whether the rigidity caused by remifentanil leads to rhabdomyolysis, but delaying the drug administration until after induction of anaesthesia should avoid most of the potential problems. \\nTrefentanil is a new opioid with a very short duration of action. Compared with alfentanil it has a larger volume of distribution but a large clearance leading to very similar half-lives. It is likely to be of little clinical benefit given the current usage of alfentanil and the major advantages of remifentanil.\\nPatient influences: The change in the distribution of age groups within populations has an immediate effect on surgical patients presenting to hospital. The progressive increase in elderly patients to over 75 years of age, and the very elderly to over 85 years of age, must dictate, to a degree, the basis for the proposed recommendations. Younger adults are both more robust from a physiological and functional reserve point of view, and are more tolerant of adverse events during surgery and anaesthesia. The changes in the distribution of ages across the surgical population will continue for the foreseeable future, and need to be incorporated in the planning for rational use of general anaesthesia. Increasing the use of drugs that have limited lipid solubility and, there- fore, little accumulation and a rapid reversal of effect, is one way to provide the elderly patient with as well tolerated an anaesthetic as their younger counterparts.\\nMany of the novel drugs are, as yet, unlicensed for use in children, and particular care has to be taken, especially with vagotonic drugs (e.g. propofol), which may cause marked bradycardia even in conventional doses.\\nSpecific disease states: \\nCardiovascular disease: Cardiovascular disease may be congenital or acquired. There are now increasing numbers of patients with corrected congenital disease presenting for surgery in their second decade with severely disordered cardiovascular function. However, this area of anaesthetic practice is beyond the scope of the current review.\\nAcquired cardiovascular disease is the most common coexisting condition in the western population presenting for surgery. In this situation, the anaesthetic technique needs to maintain the precarious balance between oxygen delivery to the myocardium and to the rest of the patient’s organs. Haemodynamic stability on induction of anaesthesia can be achieved with balanced techniques utilising high concentrations of potent opioids and induction agents with minimal cardio-depressant activity. The stress of laryngoscopy is also usually prevented by this technique.\\nMaintenance requires a balance between the changing surgical stresses and painful stimuli, and the autonomic depression caused by both volatile and intravenous anaesthetic agents. Recovery from anaesthesia has been haphazard until recently, with simple cessation of drug delivery and a reliance on the elimination of these potent drugs being the usual technique. Patients with very compromised cardiac function were admitted to intensive care units to maintain stability whilst stresses such as rewarming had occurred and good analgesia was established. Recently, managed recovery has become possible with the gradual titration of depth of anaesthesia and analgesia to allow a controlled and smooth emergence from anaesthesia.\\nPulmonary disease: Severe pulmonary disease reduces the ability of the patient to maintain adequate ventilation and gas exchange, which can be compromised during general anaesthesia. Poor matching between ventilation and perfusion, especially with the very lipid insoluble volatile agents, desflurane and sevoflurane, will lead to slow and possibly inadequate induction of anaesthesia. There will be a greater ‘fixed’ gradient between the partial pressure of the volatile anaesthetic in the alveoli and that in the blood. The monitoring of inspired gas concentrations may lead to a false sense of security and an aware patient. This gradient will also affect the reverse process and lead to a slow and incomplete recovery from anaesthesia.\\nHepatic dysfunction: The majority of the older anaesthetic agents re- lied on hepatic elimination and renal clearance. Increasingly, anaesthetic drugs are being developed that avoid direct hepatic degradation (e.g. mivacurium and cisatracurium), or are so minimally metabolised that they pose little challenge to hepatic function (e.g. desflurane). \\n\\nSpecific General Anaesthetic Techniques\\n\\nTotal Intravenous Anaesthesia: Until the introduction of propofol, attempts to provide anaesthesia entirely by intravenous agents had failed for a variety of reasons, such as dysfunction' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' of steroid production following etomidate infusions. There also remained the need to support ventilation, and this generally included nitrous oxide/oxygen gas mixtures. The incorporation of a volatile anaesthetic agent then seemed overwhelmingly logical. Importantly, there is an increased incidence of awareness using total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), especially when combined with muscle relaxation, and this limited its development for many years. Infusion schemes to allow practising anaesthetists to maintain anaesthetic levels of drugs without overdose have been published, but the great variability across age groups\\nhas limited their utility. Computerised control of the infusions was, until recently, little better.\\nThe concurrent investigation of the pharmacology of propofol with developments in computer- controlled infusions to target concentrations at the effect site, led to the practical realisation of ‘target controlled infusions’ (TCI). The only avail- able system at present is based on propofol and uses pre-filled, computer tagged 50ml syringes contain- ing 1 or 2% propofol. The apparent simplicity of use is comparable to the familiar control of vapour concentration with the volatile anaesthetic agents: the anaesthetist dials up the required effect site concentration and the pump either delivers more propofol to achieve this level or stops until the effect site concentration falls. Unfortunately, the longer the infusion is in progress the more pro- longed recovery becomes because of accumulation in the tissues.\\nThe latest version of the TCI software includes a ‘time to wake’ indication that calculates the impact this accumulation has on the free plasma drug concentration at the effect site. Analysis of the performance of this system is still preliminary, but suggests that it is failsafe by providing greater than predicted concentrations at the effect site. This feature may encourage greater use of TIVA. The final link in the TIVA chain, that of closed loop control, is limited by the lack of a reliable indicator of anaesthetic depth.\\nFollowing the clinical release of remifentanil, it has become possible to provide TIVA for very pro- longed procedures with almost the same recovery profile as that of short (<30 minute) procedures. This is because of a marked propofol sparing effect of remifentanil. Anaesthesia can be maintained with a 50 to 75% reduction of the propofol concentration. This dramatically reduces the time to wake, and allows profound anaesthesia to be maintained until the completion of surgery. Caution is necessary when the 2 agents are administered to patients with a high resting vagal tone, or where the surgery can be predicted to cause vagal stimulation, because these drugs are both vagotonic making significant bradycardia a likely risk. The addition of\\u2006 \\u2006 cisatracurium infusions provides muscle relaxation, where appropriate, again without the risks of accumulation.\\nThe development of integrated anaesthetic machines, with comprehensive monitoring and the ability to limit flows of fresh gases, has allowed the clinical use of expensive new volatile agents without vastly increasing the direct costs of each procedure. The cardiovascular stability of the recent volatile anaesthetics and the reliability of safely monitored ventilation, allow the provision of stable conditions in patients of all ages. While the choices between controlled and spontaneous ventilation, and between differing methods of air- way protection are still subject to debate, they can be made more easily with the sophisticated anaesthetic equipment now available.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\nIt is worth restating that surgery and anaesthesia have long term complications in a certain proportion of patients, and that this proportion increases with advancing age. The severity of these complications and the long term consequences are not related specifically to general anaesthesia. The avoidance or otherwise of one anaesthetic technique for another has to be based on the judgement of the anaesthetist on clinical grounds.\\nThe debate concerning the choice between specific anaesthetic techniques is highly polarised and controversial, and is largely beyond the scope of this review. However, there are a few areas where there is some consensus. When the patient is healthy, and there are no surgical reasons for making a particular decision, the choice should depend on the patient’s preferences. There is no current outcome data on whether this choice influences recovery of the patient or surgical success. Again, if the patient is healthy, there is little to choose\\nbetween the general anaesthetic techniques. Convenience, practical skills and departmental policy may dictate which induction and maintenance regimens are followed.\\nThere are some indications regarding when a specific technique holds more benefit, although the outcome data are hardly robust. These areas relate to patients with significant coexisting disease which may be exacerbated by a particular general anaesthetic technique, or where the disease process may interfere with the safe and predictable administration of the anaesthetic. The choice between a general and a local anaesthetic technique will also be influenced by the surgical procedure and the expertise' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' and experience of the surgeon and anaesthetist.\\nPatients with severe ischaemic heart disease are often unable to meet the criteria for an entirely regional local anaesthesia because they are too vulnerable to the rapid changes in pre- and afterload that occur unpredictably following intrathecal local anaesthesia. To offer any advantage, a general anaesthetic technique has to be capable of maintaining myocardial contractility and vascular tone, and avoiding significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate, whatever the anaesthetic or surgical stimulation. The use of a balanced technique utilising a potent opioid and an intravenous induction agent, with a cardio-stable muscle relaxant to permit endotracheal intubation, followed by maintenance with a volatile anaesthetic in an air/oxygen mixture will meet these criteria. This is especially so if some of the surgical stimulation can be modified by local anaesthetic techniques. The choice of agent is dependent on the likely duration of the surgery and the need, or otherwise, for a rapid, complete return to full wakefulness.\\nThe most physiologically stable induction agents, ketamine and etomidate, have undesirable cognitive or movement problems and are becoming less frequently used. Propofol, in appropriate dose ranges (1 to 1.5 mg/kg), is replacing these drugs because of physiological stability especially when combined with a potent opioid. Until recently, the choice lay between alfentanil and fentanyl as the per-operative analgesic. Where rapid protection against the stress of laryngoscopy was most important, or in short procedures, alfentanil has the better therapeutic profile because the time to peak action following intravenous injection is approximately 1 minute, with a fall to below respiratory depressant levels in a further 5 minutes. With fentanyl, there is a slower (5 minutes) time to peak action, and it takes 20 minutes for levels to fall below those causing respiratory depression. The drug is therefore suited to more prolonged surgery. Remifentanil has the potential to replace both drugs because its very rapid action equals that of alfentanil, and its potency is greater than that of fentanyl. Infusions can be titrated against surgical stresses even over prolonged periods, equalling the effectiveness of fentanyl, but with an unequalled rapidity of recovery.\\nNeuromuscular blocking drugs were used according to whether there was a need for rapidly securing the airway in the risk of gastric regurgitation and acid aspiration. The place of suxamethonium in this context has remained unchallenged, although rocuronium in high doses can provide a poorer alternative, for instance, if there is hyper- sensitivity to suxamethonium. Where the risk of aspiration is minimal, there is a choice between bolus doses of rocuronium or cisatracurium for intermediate duration procedures, or infusions of cisatracurium for prolonged cases. Mivacurium is suitable for short procedures where there is also the need for muscle relaxation.\\nMaintenance of anaesthesia can be either with volatile or intravenous anaesthetic agents. Of the current volatile anaesthetic agents, the 2 recent drugs (sevoflurane and desflurane) would appear to be equally balanced regarding risks and benefits. Sevoflurane is the more cardio-stable agent, especially with rapidly changing concentrations, but it is limited to low gas flow rates of more than 1 L/min (<2 L/min in North America) to avoid the risks of compound A formation. Desflurane has the\\nproblem of catecholamine release with rapid alterations of concentration, but can be used at low fresh gas flow (200 ml/min) and has a faster recovery time following prolonged surgery. In real terms, there is still little clinical need to alter the use of older volatile agents such as isoflurane; apart from the possible cost savings[42] that can be made if the highly lipid insoluble agents are used with rapid reductions down to basal gas flows in a circle system.\\nRecovery from anaesthesia in the patient with ischaemic heart disease has to be managed, and maintenance of anaesthesia or sedation until the return of normal physiology is essential. This can be easily achieved with the latest drugs (such as infusions of remifentanil and propofol) and may prove to be their greatest indication. The only problem at present is the need to titrate pain relief be- fore terminating the remifentanil infusion.\\nPulmonary Disease\\nPatients with pulmonary disease provide a different series of problems, and the fundamental is- sue is whether to use a disordered organ system for drug delivery and elimination if there is an alternative. For many years the use of volatile anaesthetic agents has been the only practical alternative to regional local anaesthetic techniques. However, the improvements in the mechanics of' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' TIVA have altered this situation.\\nControlled ventilation with in-line monitoring of inspired and expired gases only gives an approximation of the delivery of anaesthetic into the systemic circulation, and the risks of patient awareness increase. Using supramaximal breaths or sighs during ventilation may relieve earlier concerns regarding the reduction in pulmonary function, especially where the predicted falls in functional residual capacity may precipitate respiratory failure postoperatively. These supramaximal breaths re- expand the collapsed alveoli seen immediately on induction of anaesthesia. Such findings support the use of controlled ventilation as a well tolerated and positive method of preserving pulmonary function. TIVA with propofol, remifentanil and cisatracurium (and an anticholinergic agent) may provide well tolerated, controlled and reliable anaesthesia when volatile agents would be unpredictable. Their use also allows gradual awakening and assessment of respiratory function on recovery.The concern of an increased risk of unidentified awareness during total intravenous anaesthesia may be addressed as methods of measuring brain activity (such as the bispectral analysis technique) are validated and become affordable routine monitors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ufeffGeneral anesthesia affecting on developing brain: evidence from animal to clinical research:\\nAbstract: As the recent update of General anaesthesia compared to spinal anaesthesia (GAS) studies has been published in 2019, together with other clinical evidence, the human studies provided an overwhelming mixed evidence of an association between anaesthesia exposure in early childhood and later neurodevelopment changes in children. Pre-clinical studies in animals provided strong evidence on how anaesthetic and sedative agents (ASAs) causing neurotoxicity in developing brain and deficits in long-term cognitive functions. However pre-clinical results cannot translate to clinical practice directly. Three well designed large population-based human studies strongly indicated that a single brief exposure to general anesthesia (GAs) is not associated with any long-term neurodevelopment deficits in children’s brain. Multiple exposure might cause decrease in processing speed and motor skills of children. However, the association between GAs and neurodevelopment in children is still inconclusive. More clinical studies with larger scale observations, randomized trials with longer duration exposure of GAs and follow-ups, more sensitive outcome measurements, and strict confounder controls are needed in the future to provide more conclusive and informative data. New research area has been developed to contribute in finding solutions for clinical practice as attenuating the neurotoxic effect of ASAs. Xenon and Dexmedetomidine are already used in clinical set- ting as neuroprotection and anaesthetic sparing-effect, but more research is still needed.\\nAbbreviations: GAs (General anaesthesia)\\u2028GABA (γ-Aminobutyric acid)\\u2028NMDA (N-Methyl-d-asparate)\\u2028CNS (Central nerve system)\\u2028FDA US (Food and Drug Administration)\\n NGF (Nerve growth factor)\\nTNF (Tumour necrosis factor)\\u2028ROS (Reactive oxygen species)\\u2028PANDA (Pediatric Anaesthesia Neurodevelopment Assessment)\\u2028GAS (General anaesthesia compared to spinal anaesthesia)\\u2028MASK (Mayo Anesthesia Safety in Kids)\\nFSIQ (Full-scale intelligence quotient IQ Cognitive function)\\u2028OTB (Operant Test Battery)\\nPPP (Public–private partnership)\\n ASAs (Anaesthetic and sedative agents)\\n\\nIntroduction: The advent of the modern general anaesthesia (GAs) made it possible for the advancement of modern complex surgical and diagnostic procedures in seriously ill patients of all age groups. Anaesthetic and sedative reagents affect the central nervous system (CNS) by interacting with neurotransmitters and resolving neuronal integration between different brain regions. Presently widely used anesthetics act by two major mechanisms, (1) increasing inhibition through γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol, etomidate, isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane) and 2) decreasing the excitation via N-methyl-d-asparate (NMDA) receptors [e.g., ketamine, nitrous oxide (N2O), and xenon].\\nIn the last 20 years, more and more evidence from animal studies, including non-human primates, have indicated the potentials for GAs agents to cause neuroapoptosis and other neurodegenerative changes in the developing mammalian brain. It has been demonstrated that exposure to GAs, pre- dominately during the early postnatal period triggers long- term morphological and functional changes in the CNS, which in turn can result in impairment of neurocognitive performance. It arouse the concerns about' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' anaesthesia related neurological injury in young children among parents, health-care providers and regulatory authorities. Several human clinical studies including different outcome meas- urements interpreted the associations between surgery in early childhood and slightly worse subsequent academic per- formance or increased risk of the behavioral abnormity. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety announcement, warning that “repeated or lengthy use of general anesthetic and sedation drugs during surgeries or procedures in children younger than 3 years or in pregnant women during their third trimester may affect the develop- ment of children’s brains”. And in 2017, FDA issued a change in labeling regarding the safe use of anaesthetic and sedative reagents.\\nAs more and more clinical evidence has been revealed about how anaesthetic and sedative reagents affect develop- ment of human brain, it is more important to analyze the strengths and limitations of all the clinical evidence in order to determine the changes in clinical practice. This review will be focusing on the new findings in both pre-clinical research and clinical studies, with the brief summarization of the animal studies and current clinical evidence that have been well reported. Finally, the future and ongoing clinical studies will be discussed as the future directions for anaes- thetic research on developing brain.\\n\\nPre-clinical evidence: early-life anaesthesia exposure: The initial pre-clinical studies of anaesthesia induced developmental neurotoxicity were done with rodent models. Rodent brains undergo brain growth spurt period (synaptogenesis) mainly at postnatal time. The brain maturation reaches 90–95% of adult weight for fairly short time (post- natal day 20–21). And the key developmental processes, like synaptogenesis, blood–brain barrier establishment and oligodendrocyte maturation etc., across ages are well defined. During normal synaptogenesis, neurons that fail to develop synaptic contact will undergo programmed cell death also known as apoptosis. As for neuronal develop- ment, migration, differentiation and synaptogenesis, two of the major factors that influence all are excitatory and inhibi- tory neurotransmitters. The most important excitatory neurotransmitter that mainly contribute to neurogenesis is glutamate, which acts mainly by activating the NMDA receptor. The most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in mature brain is GABA. In the immature brain, the GABA receptor is excitatory, and its activation leads to a depolarization in the immature neuron. During development, the intracellular chloride concentration decreases, and the GABA receptor is transitioning from being excitatory to inhibitory receptor in the adult brain. Other important factors that involves in neurogenesis are growth factors, like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These factors mainly regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells, axo- and dendrite-genesis, as well as neuronal cell survival.\\nAs known that all commonly used anesthetic and sedative reagents provide anaesthetic and sedative effects by binding to the GABA receptor, or the NMDA receptor, or both. The first animal study by Jevtovic-Todorovic et al., demonstrated that routine GAs (isoflurane, sevoflurane, propofol, ketamine) are capable of producing lasting cognitive, behavioral and memory deficiency in postnatal day 7 rats when exposed with 6 h mixture of nitro oxide, isoflurane and midazolam. More cellular and animal studies have provided substantial and convincing evidence on the cytotoxic and neurotoxic effects of GAs. Furthermore, studies on non-human primates aligned with the results in rodents research, finding that early-life exposure to ketamine, sevoflurane or isoflurane can lead to persistent decline in cognitive, executive, memory and motivation-based tasks, and increase anxiety behaviours in long term.\\nThe molecular mechanisms of cytotoxic and neurotoxic effect of general anaesthetics on developing brain have been extensively explored. In-vitro and in-vivo studies have revealed that anaesthetics induce apoptosis via two possible pathways: intrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is activated via tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptors. While the intrinsic pathway is initiated in response to signals from within the cell, this results in the decreasing anti-apoptotic BCL-2/pro-apoptotic Bax ratio, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and promoting cytochrome C to be released from the mitochondria and activating caspase-3 cleavage. GAs accelerates the process of apoptosis during the period when GABA receptor is excitatory. While applying the GAs at a later neuronal development stage when GABA receptor is inhibitory, it induces less neurodegeneration. However, the' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' negative effects on learning and memory are still exist. Both long-term block- age of excitatory and the activation of inhibitory receptors, neuronal synapses may induce a change in receptor expression. This might influence the excitability of the neuron and make it more vulnerable to toxic stimuli. For neuronal development, both excitatory and inhibitory input from adjacent neurons are essential. By blocking the connection from adjacent neurons, the differentiation and survival might be critically affected. Other studies also suggested that GAs causes deficit in axon myelination by affecting glial cells. Recently anaesthetic-induced neuroinflammation has\\u2006 \\u2006 been revealed as a possible mechanism for cognitive impairment in immature mice.\\nThe current available animal studies give rises to several important indications of factors that affect toxicity of early- life anaesthesia on animals. First is the developmental stage at which animals are exposed to GAs. Neuronal cells tend to be more vulnerable during the brain growth spurt period. And the timing of this period varies from species, in rat, it lasts from the 7th up to 17th postnatal day and in rhesus monkeys from the 5th to the 16th postnatal day. The peak period of synaptogenesis various between brain regions and different neuronal cell types. Different neuronal cell types may possess different susceptibility to GAs. Glutaminergic and GABAergic neurons may be more vulnerable to toxic effects than cholinergic neurons.\\nSecond important factor is the length and frequency of exposure to the general anaesthetics. Neurocognitive deficits have been identified after several hours GAs administration but not after short-term single administration of GAs. Repeated, short-time exposures to the GAs also results in cognitive dysfunction, indicating that accumulative length of exposure to GAs within a certain period of time is one of key factors.\\nThird, a dose-dependent toxicity effect has been revealed in animal studies. Higher the dose of GAs is, the larger the number of apoptotic neurons is. The dosage of GAs can affect the degree of developmental impairment, cell differentiation and synaptogenesis.\\nLastly, recent studies suggest that the sensitivity to GAs may vary between sexes. One study in rats showed males and females followed distinct paths of neural and cognitive development after an early anesthetic-mediated effect on the brain. Both male and female rats exhibited extensive neuronal death. However drastic behavioral impairment was manifested only in male subjects. \\n\\nThe gap and limitation of the findings from animal studies transferring to clinical practice: Researchers have focused substantial attention to evaluating the development of cognitive abilities of animals exposed to GAs at the peak of synaptogenesis. It has been concluded that GAs exposure animals showed abnormality in memory and cognitive in adulthood comparing with GAs non- exposure animals. Both single long exposure and repeatedly, short-term exposure to GAs during critical stage of brain development can cause significant impairments in neurocognitive development. We know that the critical stages of brain development various from species. Then how to imply the findings from animal research to clinical practice? In human brain, the synaptogenesis period is thought to last from the last trimester until the third year of life which is way longer comparing to rodent and rhesus monkeys. It is hard to imply the critical development stages that mostly affected by GAs directly from animal studies. Besides, the animal studies basically used healthy animals to expose to GAs. In the clinical situation, it is often with children in need of surgery, whom might be exposed to prolonged surgeries and have multiple postoperative complications, like pain, anxiety, fluid imbalance, and surgery-induced trauma. There are only limited animal studies including surgical or pain stimuli into consideration, but the results are contradictory. One study published in 2012 by Shu et al., showed that rat pups who received GAs for 6 h with a hind paw incision or formalin injection respectively, exhibited higher degree of neuroapoptosis in brain cortex and spinal cord. These subjects also showed long-term impairments comparing to age-matched animals which have been exposed to GAs alone without nociceptive stimulus. Interestingly another study published in the same year by Liu et al., suggested that 6 h exposure of rat pups to GAs with chemical nociception induced by complete Freund’s adjuvant resulted in attenuated anaesthesia-induced neuroapoptotic response. Cognitive behavior in later life was not assessed. All these indicating that the real situation in clinical setting is way more complicated. It would be challenging to establish a clear relevance of the animal studies to clinical practice. However pre-clinical animal studies are still valuable as they revealed the molecular and cellular mechanism for GAs toxicity in developing brain. The behavior and pathological data from animal studies can provide reference for the designing clinical studies.\\n\\nClinical evidence: what we can imply from all the clinical data and what’s next: The first reported study' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' in 1953 by Eckenhoff et al., suggested possible relevance between personality change and preanaesthetic medication (pentobarbital, scopolamine and morphine). However no clear link between surgery and neurodevelopmental outcome had been noticed outside the neonatal period. There was no obvious clinical problem, until the pre- clinical data has grown. There was an increasing urge to find out if GAs exposure does indeed cause the clinical relevance of neurodevelopment dysfunction in children. The answer to this question is not easy or straightforward. There are many aspects and concerns needed to be taken into consideration, regarding the GAs effects on children. The effect might be dependent on the choice of anaesthetics. The GAs approach varies based on the child’s age, medical/surgical history, types of surgical procedure and duration of anaesthesia administration and the nature of the anaesthesia exposure. Unfortunately, translation pre-clinical data in human is imprecise and inapplicable. A recent review by integrating more than 440 pre-clinical studies with exceed 30 clinical studies up to date, demonstrated no clear exposure duration threshold below which no structural injury or subsequent cognitive abnormalities occurred. Animal data did not clearly identify a specific age beyond which anaesthetic exposure did not cause any structural or functional abnormalities. All these make it even harder for human studies to use pre-clinical data as a guideline to design clinical research.\\nGiven the uncertainty of translating the pre-clinical data, it is impossible to design a single randomized controlled human study including all the affecting factors to determine the outcomes. It is more appropriate for a range of studies to examine a range of outcomes, anaesthetic duration and age at exposure. Many elaborate reviews on this topic have been published recently and assessed most of the clinical studies. In this review, we will briefly summarize the up- to-date and the most well designed three clinical studies and discuss the limitations. Most importantly, we will discuss the implications from human studies that can guide the clinical practice and future directions for designing clinical research. \\n\\nThe Pediatric Anaesthesia Neurodevelopment Assessment (PANDA) Study: PANDA study used a sibling-matched cohort design to test if a single anaesthesia exposure in healthy young children is associated with impaired neurocognitive development and abnormal behavior in later children. The study cohort included sibling pairs within 36 months in age and currently 8–15 years old. All exposed children received inhaled anaesthetic agents and anaesthesia median duration of 80 min. 105 sibling pairs were included in the primary outcome, global cognitive function (IQ) test. There was no statistically significantly differences in mean scores between exposed siblings and unexposed siblings. A detailed neuropsychological battery assessed IQ and domain-specific neurocognitive functions as the secondary outcomes also showed no statistically significant differences between sibling pairs in memory/learning, motor/processing speed, visuospatial function, attention, executive function, language, or behavior.\\n\\nThe general anaesthesia compared to spinal anaesthesia (GAS) study: The first randomised trial was designed as GAS consortium to verify whether anaesthesia exposure in early childhood can cause long-term neurodevelopment changes. Two estab- lished anaesthetic techniques for inguinal herniorrhaphy\\ntreating postoperative apnea in young infant: awake- regional and sevoflurane-based Gas. Between the year 2007–2013, 722 infants up to 60 weeks who were recruited in the trial from 28 hospitals in multiple countries were randomly assigned to receive either awake-regional or sevoflurane-based GAs for inguinal herniorrhaphy. The median duration of anaesthesia in the GAs group was 54 min. The outcomes of neurodevelopment were assessed at 2 years of age and 5 years of age respectively. The secondary outcome, the composite cognitive score of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III, assessed at 2 years of age and published in 2016, providing strong evidence for equivalence between awake-regional anaesthesia and GAs in infancy in terms of neurodevelopment. The primary outcome measure was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition at 5 years of age published recently in 2019. The results were interpreted that slightly less than 1 h of GAs in early infancy does not alter neurodevelopmental outcome at 5 years of age compared with awake-regional anaesthesia in a predominantly male study population. \\n\\nMayo Anesthesia Safety in Kids (MASK) study: MASK study enrolled children born in Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA, from 1994 to 2007, who were exposed to surgery and anaesthesia before the age of 3 year. Total 997 children were enrolled in the MASK study. 380 children had a single exposure to GAs, 206 children had multiple exposure to GAs, and 411 were unexposed' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text='. Enrolled children were sampled using a propensity-guided approach and underwent neuropsychological testing at age 8–12 or 15–20 year. The primary outcome based on the Full-Scale intelligence quotient standard score of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence did not differ significantly according to exposure status. Secondary assessment including individual domains from a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and parent reports, found that processing speed and fine motor abilities were decreased in the multiple but not the single exposed children. Other functions did not show significant difference accordingly. The parents of multiple exposed children reported increased problems related to executive function, behaviour, and reading.\\nTwo follow-up studies of MASK study attempted to translate the non-human primate data to humans and per- form additional analysis to verify the results. One follow-up study done by Warner et al., proposed reasons for the variability in the results of anaesthetics clinical neurotoxicity. As with neurotoxic exposure, not all cognitive domains might be equally affected and specific domains that are affected by GAs are still not clear. By applying the knowledge from animal studies, Warner and colleagues picked the neurodevelopment test, Operant Test Battery (OTB) which can be used both in humans and animals. There was no difference found in OTB scores even after multiple exposure in children. However, previous non- human primate studies showed decrease in OTB accuracy and response speed after anaesthetic exposure. The difference of the findings might be due to the insensitivity of OTB test for detecting small effects in children. Also the median anaesthetic exposure duration for children in MASK study was 45 min for single exposure and 187 min for multiple exposure, while the non-human primate study used a 24 h infusion of ketamine, which is not only a very long exposure but also an anaesthetic drug that is not the choice in most paediatric procedures. This MASK study find- ing is consistent with other published studies showing that anaesthetic exposure does not result in large cognitive deficits, particularly in domains associated with intelligence.\\nThe other MASK follow-up study done by Zaccariello et al., preformed a secondary re-analysis of some of the neuropsychologist-assessed outcomes presented in the initial MASK study. Two analyses, a factor and a cluster analysis were performed in this follow-up study. The results showed that children with multiple exposures had lower scores in processing speed, motor coordination and visual- motor integration, but no differences were seen in the children after a single exposure.\\nGAS and PANDA studies provided strong evidence that infants exposing to a single brief (less than 1 h) GAs does not cause significant neurocognitive or behavioural deficits. The MASK study also verified the same conclusion. Besides, MASK study provided evidence that not the single exposure but the multiple exposure to GAs in young children is associated with a specific pattern of deficits. However, this is just the beginning of understanding how GAs affects neurodevelopment in infants. The current published clinical studies have limitations to address the issue thoroughly and there are still missing puzzles.\\nFirst of all, the dosage dependent effect of GAs is still not clear. GAS and PANDA studies all used less than 1 h brief anaesthetic exposure showing no effect in long-term neurodevelopment. MASK studies indicated that single average 45 min exposure does not affect gross neurodevelopment, while multiple exposure with average of 187 min period caused the deficits in fine motor skills. Current results do not provide data regarding to the neurocognitive risks of repeated episodes of anesthesia exposure or more prolonged durations of a single exposure which often happen in com- plicated pediatric surgeries.\\nSecondly, the current cognitive and behavioral tests used for clinical studies are not sensitive enough to analysis in depth how affected sub-domains in the brain are. Like the Bayley III assessment method used in GAS studies is a well validated assessment for current neurodevelopment and early neurobehavioral assessment of children. However, it is not a perfect predictor for long-term outcome. Further analysis of the data collected from current clinical studies could also provide more information and evidence.\\nThirdly, the GAs effect on different sex has not been fully addressed in the PANDA and GAS study. Pre-clinical data indicated that anaesthetic drugs might affect long-term cognitive function differently between sexes. Only MASK studies females and males were equally recruited in the studies, but not separately analyzed. In PANDA and GAS studies, the majority of the recruited children were males.\\nLast but not least, all three studies were assessed the association between surgery plus anesthetic exposure and cognitive/behavior deficiency. It is hard to rule out the impact of the surgery contribution to the outcomes. Furthermore, confounders such as hypotension, body temperature, and hypoxia during surgery are rarely included in these studies. These confounders could potentially alter the outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",

In many parts of the world, there has been a reduction in anaesthetic associated obstetric mortality, and this has been attributed to the increased use of neuraxial anaesthesia and improved safety of general anaesthesia, alongside improved training and organisational changes. In resource-limited countries, anaesthesia contributes disproportionately to maternal mortality, with one in seven deaths being due to anaesthesia. A major contributory factor to this is the severe shortage of trained anaesthetic providers. Goals for anaesthesia for CS include the woman's comfort and foetal well-being, focusing on strategies to minimise morbidity and mortality for both. Anaesthetic options for CS include neuraxial techniques (spinal or combined-spinal epidural or epidural extension of labour analgesia) and general anaesthesia. There is increasing evidence of the benefit of neuraxial techniques over general anaesthesia in terms of maternal and foetal outcomes. For elective CS, spinal and combined-spinal anaesthesia predominate. General anaesthesia is mainly reserved for Category 1 CS where there is an immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby. This review discusses the practical aspects of neuraxial and general anaesthesia for CS. \\nIntroduction: Caesarean section (CS) is one of the most commonly performed operations worldwide, with 1 in 5 women (21.1%) currently giving birth through this route. However, rates of CS vary widely, ranging from an average of 5% in sub-Saharan Africa to 42.8% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The rate is increasing globally, and it is estimated that by 2030, 28.5% of women will give birth by CS. In contrast to spontaneous vaginal delivery, there is an absolute requirement for anaesthesia for CS. Increasing rates of CS are likely to impact upon the obstetric anaesthetic workload. Anaesthetic associated obstetric mortality is relatively low in high-income countries. In the UK, direct anaesthetic maternal mortality associated with CS has decreased 240-fold over the last 40 years from 36 per 100,000 CS in 1966 to 0.15 per 100,000 in 2018. This reduction is attributed to the increased use of neuraxial anaesthesia for CS, improved safety of neuraxial techniques, algorithms and airway devices to improve the safety of general anaesthesia, and improved training and organisational changes. The picture is different in resource-limited countries, where maternal mortality is approximately fifty times higher than in high-income countries. Anaesthesia contributes disproportionately to this mortality, with one in seven deaths being due to anaesthesia. Several factors contribute to this including the severe shortage of trained anaesthetic providers; in some areas, there is only one physician anaesthetist per million women. Exposure to general anaesthesia and non-physician anaesthetists is associated with increased risk to mothers in low- and middle-income countries. Increased risk due to general anaesthesia may be linked to poor maternal condition (such as in obstetric haemorrhage), but in one South African report, 10 out of 92 anaesthetic deaths were related to complications of general anaesthesia conducted for an inadequate spinal block. In contrast to other causes of maternal mortality, death due to anaesthesia represents an iatrogenic cause. This point particularly behoves anaesthesia providers to seek ways to optimise care. Goals for anaesthesia for CS must include the woman's comfort and foetal well-being, with a specific focus on strategies to minimise morbidity and mortality for both. This review will discuss the management of neuraxial and general anaesthesia for CS.\\nClassification of the urgency of caesarean section: The urgency of CS will affect the choice of anaesthesia. The classification of the urgency of CS is based on the presence or absence of maternal and/or foetal compromise. In a widely used classification, Category 1 is the most urgent and is defined as an immediate threat to the life of either the woman or the foetus. Category 4 describes elective surgery where there is no maternal or foetal compromise, e.g., delivery for breech presentation in a woman who is not in labour.\\nChoice of anaesthesia for CS: Anaesthesia for CS can broadly be divided into neuraxial anaesthesia and general anaesthesia. Neuraxial may be desirable both socially and emotionally, as in contrast to general anaesthesia, a birth partner is usually encouraged to be present in the operating room for delivery, and skin-to-skin contact can be established very soon after delivery. Other advantages of neuraxial anaesthesia over general anaesthesia include improved postoperative analgesia, a reduction in haemorrhage, and higher Apgar scores in\" metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' the neonate. There is accumulating evidence of the relative safety of neuraxial anaesthesia compared to general anaesthesia for CS. Compared with neuraxial anaesthesia, general anaesthesia is associated with significantly increased risks of maternal adverse events, including death, cardiac arrest, anaesthesia-related complications (difficult or failed intubation, accidental awareness during general anaesthesia), surgical site infection, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. These risks are increased in avoidable general anaesthetics, i.e., general anaesthesia per- formed without a recorded indication for general anaesthesia or contraindication to neuraxial anaesthesia. General anaesthesia also appears to increase the risk for the neonate. A large population- based study examined neonatal and early infant outcomes following different modes of anaesthesia for CS. Compared with spinal anaesthesia, general anaesthesia was associated with an increased risk of neonatal resuscitation, Apgar <7 at 5 min and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Crucially, these associations were strongest in non-urgent cases and at term, where the foetus was less likely to be suffering from pre-existing compromise.\\nGiven the advantages of neuraxial anaesthesia and disadvantages of general anaesthesia, neuraxial anaesthesia is usually the preferred choice for CS in the absence of contraindications, e.g., patient refusal, coagulation abnormalities, raised intracranial pressure, certain spinal pathology or surgery, systemic sepsis, or localised skin infection. However, general anaesthesia is usually considered to be faster and most likely to reduce the decision-to-delivery interval. Therefore, it may be preferred in the most urgent, Category 1 scenarios, where minimising the decision-to-delivery interval is essential, e.g., persistent foetal bradycardia, which does not resolve with intrauterine resuscitation. General anaesthesia may also be favoured in patients with haemodynamic instability due to massive haemorrhage or in women with sepsis.\\nNeuraxial anaesthesia for elective CS: The choice of anaesthesia for elective CS principally lies with spinal or combined-spinal epidural anaesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia alone is the most commonly used technique. It provides rapid onset, effective, and reliable anaesthesia. The duration of a single-shot spinal is variable and depends on the agents used but usually provides adequate surgical anaesthesia for around 90 min.\\nThe placement of a spinal anaesthetic is technically easier than an epidural or combined-spinal epidural. Combined-spinal epidural offers the potential to extend anaesthesia in the event of spinal failure or during prolonged surgery. However, studies have not demonstrated the superiority of one technique. Spinal anaesthesia can be safely used in patients with comorbidities such as preeclampsia and cardiac disease.\\nTypically, spinal anaesthesia includes a local anaesthetic such as bupivacaine with an opioid. Isobaric (plain) or hyperbaric (produced by the addition of glucose (80 mg.ml1) to isobaric bupiva- caine) preparations of local anaesthetic can be used. Although studies have failed to demonstrate an advantage of hyperbaric over isobaric bupivacaine in terms of conversion rates to general anaesthesia or the need for supplemental analgesia, limited evidence suggests a faster speed of onset with hy- perbaric solutions, and they are generally favoured. However, the speed of onset may also be affected by the position of the patient (during spinal placement and immediately afterwards) and the total dose of local anaesthetic. The commonly recommended dose of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine is between 10 and 15 mg. The challenge lies in balancing the lowest possible dose to produce surgical anaesthesia and therefore minimise side effects, particularly spinal hypotension with the risk of inadequate anaesthesia. A systematic review assessed the difference between low-dose hy- perbaric bupivacaine (8 mg) with high-dose (8 mg) for elective CS. In the low-dose group, the authors found a significant reduction in intraoperative hypotension (RR 1⁄4 0.78) and nausea and vomiting (RR 1⁄4 0.71). However, this advantage was negated by a significantly increased need for supplemental analgesia (RR 1⁄4 3.76) and need for conversion to general anaesthesia. If a low-dose technique is chosen, this should mandate the use of combined-spinal epidural anaesthesia to enable the extension of anaesthesia if required.\\nThe addition of an opioid can contribute to intraoperative anaesthesia quality and improve post- operative analgesia. Long-acting neuraxial opioids are a cornerstone for post-CS analgesia' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' and are recommended in international guidance. The pharmacokinetic characteristic of the drugs de- termines the choice of neuraxial opioids. Hydrophilic opioids, e.g., morphine, enter the spinal cord slowly to bind to specific opioid receptors. They also penetrate the dura and epidural adipose tissue slowly, thus resulting in delayed clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to slower onset (30e60 min) but much longer, dose-dependent duration of action (13e33 h). In contrast, lipophilic opioids, e.g., fentanyl or sufentanil, enter the spinal cord quickly and are then swiftly distributed into epidural adipose tissue and the systemic circulation leading to a rapid onset (10e20 min) and shorter duration of analgesic action (4e6 h). The difference in the therapeutic profile between these opioids allows the option for intrathecal administration of a combination of fentanyl and morphine with the local anaesthetic. The fentanyl dose would supplement the local anaesthetic effects and analgesia during a CS while morphine would provide longer duration postoperative analgesia.\\nNeuraxial opioids can be associated with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, and respiratory depression. The dose of opioid has to balance achieving optimal postoperative anal- gesia with the lowest incidence of side effects. A meta-analysis examined outcomes in women who underwent CS under spinal anaesthesia comparing low-dose (between 50 and 100 mg) to high-dose (>100e250 mg) intrathecal morphine. There was a significant prolongation of analgesia in the high-dose group compared with the low-dose group (mean difference 4.4e5.9 h). There were no differences in pain scores at 12 and 24 h after delivery between groups and morphine consumption at 24 h was similar between groups. The incidence of pruritus was greater in the high-dose group.\\nThe most feared complication of neuraxial opioids is delayed respiratory depression. The risk of delayed respiratory depression in women who received neuraxial morphine or diamorphine during CS was examined in a systematic review. The authors estimated the highest (definite and probable/ possible cases) and lowest (definite cases) prevalence of clinically significant respiratory depression with all doses of neuraxial opioids. The highest prevalence was 8.67 per 10,000 (95% CI, 4.20e15.16), and lowest prevalence was 5.96 per 10,000 (95% CI, 2.23e11.28), respectively. The highest and lowest prevalence of clinically significant respiratory depression with clinically relevant doses of neuraxial morphine ranged between 1.63 per 10,000 (95% CI, 0.62e8.77) and 1.08 per 10,000 (95% CI, 0.24e7.22), respectively. The prevalence of clinically significant respiratory depression due to neuraxial morphine or diamorphine in the obstetric population is low. Practice recommendations about the respiratory rate and sedation monitoring vary slightly. The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology recom- mend that with low-dose intrathecal morphine (>0.05 to 0.15 mg) or epidural morphine (>1 mg to 3 mg) in low-risk, healthy parturients, it is reasonable to monitor with respiratory rate and sedation measurement every 2 hours for 12 hours postoperatively. In the UK, extended monitoring is only recommended in women at high risk of respiratory depression, e.g., women with an increased body mass index or diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea.\\nNeuraxial anaesthesia for emergency CS: If a CS is needed in a woman with an existing labour epidural, it is common practice to ‘top-up’ the epidural to convert labour analgesia to surgical anaesthesia. Around 18% of emergency CS are undertaken in the UK using this technique. Key considerations to ensure effective and safe management of topping-up an epidural are which epidurals to top-up, what drug to use and where to initiate the top-up. The likelihood of successfully converting labour analgesia for CS is increased if the epidural has provided effective pain relief in labour. In a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess for risk factors for failure of conversion of analgesia for CS, three factors were associated with an increased risk for failed conversion : An increasing number of clinician-administered boluses during labour (OR 1⁄4 3.2, 95% CI 1.8e5.5).\\u2006 \\u2006 Greater urgency for CS (OR 1⁄4 40.4, 95% CI 8.8e186).\\u2028 A non-obstetric anaesthetist providing care (OR 1⁄4 4.6, 95% CI 1.8e11.5' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=').\\nThe first two of these factors (clinician-administered boluses and urgency of CS), underline the essential role of the anaesthetist as part of the labour ward multidisciplinary team and active anaes- thetic care in the labour ward. This includes early recognition and management (e.g., with re-site of a poorly performing epidural) and maintaining ongoing communication with the obstetric team to identify those women most likely to require a CS. Structured clinical handover tools can reduce the chances of critical omissions during handovers in obstetric anaesthesia and ensure that labour epi- durals are reviewed regularly.\\nThe most effective and fastest epidural top-up solution has been widely discussed. The heterogeneous nature of studies limits comparisons, e.g., studies comparing elective and emergency CS, different regi- mens used during labour before the top-up, and different methods of block assessment. A recent network meta-analysis assessed the speed of onset of six local anaesthetics commonly used to extend labour epidural analgesia for CS. The speeds of onset of surgical anaesthesia, from fastest to slowest, were as follows: lidocaine 2% with bicarbonate; 2-chloroprocaine 3%; lidocaine 2%; ropivacaine 0.75%; L-bupiva- caine 0.5%; bupivacaine 0.5%. The mean (95% credible interval, CrI) onset time after bupivacaine 0.5% was 19.8 (17.3e22.4) min, with the mean (95% CrI) speed of onset after lidocaine 2% with bicarbonate being 6.4 (3.3e9.6) min faster. The rate (CrI) of intraoperative supplementation of analgesia was least after ropi- vacaine, 0.75%, 48 (19e118) per 1000 and highest after 2-chloroprocaine, 3%, 250 (112e569) per 1000.\\nAlongside these characteristics another but infrequently considered aspect of extending labour epidural anaesthesia is the impact of preparation times for local anaesthetic solutions and safety of this practice. Because of concerns about the instability of previously mixed preparations of local anaesthetic and additives such as epinephrine and bicarbonate, solutions are usually made up immediately before use. There is, therefore, the potential for a delay while such solutions are prepared. The more complex the mixture, the greater the potential for errors during preparation, especially when in a hurry. Other hazards of mixing solutions include the possibility of bacterial contamination and drug incompatibility; for example, adding bicarbonate 2 ml to 0.5% bupivacaine 20 ml causes instant precipitation. Another consideration is the variation possible that can occur when mixing very small quantities of drugs, with the final concentration being affected by the dead space of the in- strument used for aspiration and the presence of air bubbles in tiny volumes of injectate.\\nIt is the authors’ view that the balance of speed of onset, requirement for intraoperative supple- mentation, and safety is best met by drugs that do not require preparation before use, e.g., ropivacaine 0.75% or premixed solutions of preservative-free 2% lidocaine and epinephrine.\\nBefore any epidural extension, a ‘test dose’ is recommended to ensure there has not been intrathecal migration of the catheter, thus reducing the risk of high or total spinal blockade. One study found that gentle aspiration of the epidural catheter alone was associated with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100% of identifying an intrathecal catheter, but there has been little further data to support this. There is also limited evidence to support the best method of a test dose. Individual studies have hinted towards the use of 2e3 ml of 2% lignocaine due to its rapid onset of action if injected intrathecally (objective block at 90 s compared with no block with an epidural injection at this same time point) compared with longer-acting local anaesthetics. Other suggestions include a bolus of fentanyl that may be useful in identifying an intravascular epidural catheter due to rapid onset of sedation, drowsiness, or dizziness, but there is no evidence to support this as any more beneficial than a simple negative aspiration. Further evidence is clearly required for future practice. At present, many anaesthetists are reassured by the absence of a rapid (within 3e5 min) onset of a surgical block with 3e5 ml of their chosen extension local anaesthetic. However, a survey conducted in 2008 identified that only 34% of respondents admitted to regularly performing a test dose.\\u2028The role' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=\" of adding an opioid drug to the local anaesthetic for epidural extension is unclear. Some studies suggest it may increase the speed of onset, although there did not appear to be any effect on the requirement for intraoperative supplementation. However, this effect is not consistent, possibly due to maximal effect in some patients having already been achieved through the low-dose fentanyl in the labour epidural mixture. The benefit of adding opioid to the top-up mixture needs to be balanced\\nwith the risk of increased side effects, e.g., nausea and vomiting.\\u2028The location of administration of epidural top-up to convert epidural analgesia to anaesthesia for CS remains controversial. Topping-up in the delivery room can minimise the decision-to-delivery interval. However, topping-up in the operating room may be safer. Evidence from practice surveys suggest that anaesthetists are developing a more cautious approach; in 2008, 68% of anaesthetists chose to give the full epidural top-up in the delivery room compared to only 14% in 2014. A pragmatic approach may be for the anaesthetist to support the labour ward team in expediting patient transfer to the operating room rather than topping-up in the delivery room. If the top-up is administered or started in the delivery room, the anaesthetist must ensure that they have both monitoring and vasopressor drugs immediately to hand, to recognise and manage acute complications such as high neuraxial block. \\nNeuraxial anaesthesia for CS - general considerations: Hypotension following spinal and combined-spinal epidural anaesthesia is common and can cause maternal and foetal/neonatal adverse effects. It may also arise with the extension of labour epidural analgesia. It is paramount that prophylactic measures are used, and there is international guidance on this topic. Although neuraxial anaesthesia is generally reliable, failure, either complete or partial, can be associated with intraoperative pain. A woman who experiences pain during CS under neuraxial anaesthesia is at risk of adverse psychological sequelae. The risk of failure of neuraxial anaesthesia must be minimised by using a recognised technique with sufficient doses of local anaesthetic and opioids and an assessment of the neuraxial block before starting surgery. Finally, it is essential that if a woman experiences pain during CS under neuraxial anaesthesia, this is managed appropriately, including converting to general anaesthesia. If a clinician disregards a woman's experience intra- operatively, it may compound her distress, which can contribute to psychological trauma.\\nObjective assessment of neuraxial anaesthesia can be challenging. Surveys of neuraxial block assessment before CS reveal significant variation in practice. The urgent need for guidelines to support best practice and offer a standard approach to practice in this area has been recognised by the publication of national guidelines in the UK and France. Both guidelines focus on three thematic areas: patient consent, assessment of the neuraxial block, and management of intraoperative pain. Additionally, they emphasise the critical role of communication at all stages of clinical care and finally highlight the crucial role of follow-up for women who experience pain and distress during CS under neuraxial anaesthesia. \\n\\nGeneral anaesthesia for CS: During general anaesthesia for CS, a significant area of concern is the increased risk of airway complications. Pregnant women have a higher risk of difficult or failed intubation, the development of hypoxaemia during induction and intubation, and pulmonary aspiration. The incidence of failed tracheal intubation during general anaesthesia for CS has been estimated as one in 443. In 2015, the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association and Difficult Airway Society (OAA/DAS) published guidelines for managing difficult and failed tracheal intubation in obstetrics. These guidelines provide al- gorithms for the safe provision of general anaesthesia in obstetrics, failed tracheal intubation, and ‘cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate’ situations. They also describe factors to assist with decision-making around whether to wake a woman or proceed following failed tracheal intubation. \\nOptimum positioning should be the teaching and practice norm for all obstetric patients under- going general anaesthesia. In a small qualitative observational study to identify difficulties associated with intubation by inexperienced personnel, Satyapal noted that the commonest mistake was a failure to ensure the optimal head positioning before intubation and the absence of a pillow. The authors commented that ‘the scarcity of pillows in resource-constrained hospitals should be regarded not as an inconvenient laundry issue but as a serious lack of vital equipment.’ Pillows may not always be available, but the anaesthetist must ensure optimal position of the patient's head\" metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' using whatever is convenient, practical, and available. The head elevated laryngoscopy position (a 25 head elevation) combined with the ramped position (horizontal alignment between the external auditory meatus and sternal notch) can improve airway management (cricoid pressure, insertion of laryngoscope, and view at intubation). This position may also increase functional residual capacity in parturients, which may increase the time to desaturation after the onset of apnoea. The ramped position can be achieved using pillows or specific devices (e.g., Oxford Head Elevating Laryngoscopy Pillow (HELP) System®). While videolaryngoscopy has transformed airway management in anaesthesia, its role in obstetric general anaesthesia has been subject to less scrutiny than in other areas of anaesthesia. There are inherent difficulties with research in obstetric general anaesthesia; smaller overall numbers of general anaesthetics given, and most cases occuring in the emergency setting. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intu- bation in obstetrics identified only four RCTs, nine observational studies, and 35 case reports/series with a total of only 528 participants. The authors found that in obstetric patients without pre- dictors of difficult intubation, videolaryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy in the hands of experienced operators does not affect the first-pass success rate at tracheal intubation with no dif- ference in the time to tracheal intubation. Nevertheless, the small number of available studies and case reports in obstetrics, coupled with information from the non-obstetric population, do support the use of videolaryngoscopy in obstetrics. The OAA/DAS guidelines recommend that videolaryngoscopes should be immediately available on the labour ward. \\nRapid sequence induction of anaesthesia remains the preferred mode in obstetric general anaes- thesia. The most commonly used induction agents are propofol, thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine. In the UK, thiopental persisted for many years as the induction agent of choice. The publication of two national reports led to a revaluation of the role of thiopental in obstetric general anaesthesia. The 5th National Audit Project investigated accidental awareness under general anaesthesia. In this report, 14 cases of awareness in obstetric anaesthesia were reported e approximately 10% of reports e while obstetric general anaesthetics represented only 0.8% of the total general anaesthetics given. Thiopental was the most commonly used induction agent in the cases of accidental awareness: this association between an increased risk of accidental awareness and thiopental use was confirmed in a recent prospective investigation of obstetric general anaesthesia. The second report that highlighted issues with the use of thiopental as an induction agent in obstetrics was the 2014 Report on Confi- dential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths. The report commented on the finding that in some maternal deaths, the dose of thiopental (and occasionally, propofol) used for induction of anaesthesia in severely ill women (e.g., those with septic or haemorrhagic shock) seemed excessive. This finding served to highlight the increasing unfamiliarity of anaesthetists with thiopental. More recently, a multicentre study from France investigating the incidence of hypoxaemia during induction of general anaesthesia found the risk was increased with an induction agent other than propofol. \\nIt is increasingly recognised that some of the dogmas associated with the rapid sequence induction technique lack an evidence base and may in some cases contribute to poor outcomes. For example, manual bag-mask ventilation has traditionally been avoided during rapid sequence induction for fear of creating gastric insufflation sufficient to cause aspiration. The evidence that gentle bag-mask ventilation increases the risk of aspiration is non-existent, and it enables the anaesthetists to continue oxygenation during the apnoeic period. Similarly, opioids have traditionally been avoided as a component of rapid sequence induction for CS because of concerns about potential adverse effects on the neonate and, in the event of failed intubation and discontinuation of anaesthesia, potentially delaying the return of spon- taneous ventilation in the mother. There is limited data to support either of these assertions. Opioids are effective sympatholytic agents. They can also reduce the ‘induction agent e maintenance inhalational gap’ that has been identified as a specific problem in general anaesthesia for CS, because surgery starts so soon after induction and potentially increases the risk of accidental awareness. Previous surveys have identified a disparity between opioid use in obstetric vs.' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=\" non-obstetric rapid sequence induction, with greater use outside the obstetric setting. A recent meta-analysis has shown that induction opioids (remifentanil and alfentanil, in particular) appear to be safe, with no significant effect on Apgar scores or neonatal airway intervention. If a short-acting opioid such as alfentanil is used during induction, it is good practice to inform the neonatologist at delivery.\\nWhile supraglottic airway (SGA) devices have an established role in difficult or failed intubation in obstetric general anaesthesia, there is limited evidence to support a role as the primary airway device. There are no published trials comparing the use of SGA devices with endotracheal intubation in the setting of emergency CS, but there are several studies describing their use during low-risk, elective CS. A recent systematic review compared SGA devices with endotracheal intubation in low-risk patients for CS. They identified fourteen studies with 2236 patients comparing SGA and endotracheal intuba- tion. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in first-attempt success rates (OR 1⁄4 1.92; 95% CI, 0.85e4.32; I 1⁄4 0%; P 1⁄4 0.44) and no clinically significant difference in time to insertion. There was no difference in any adverse event rate except sore throat, which was reduced with the use of an SGA device (OR 1⁄4 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08e0.32 P < 0.001). The limitations of the underlying studies (elective, low-risk population) preclude the extrapolation of this evidence to emergency CS. Even routine use during elective CS cannot be recommended until further evidence is available.\\nRecovery from anaesthesia after CS: After CS and regardless of the mode of anaesthesia, all patients must receive the same standard of recovery care as per recovery from anaesthesia in any other surgical speciality, i.e., with staff trained in post-anaesthetic care and an environment containing adequate space and equipment for providing safe and effective care. Equipment should include blood pressure, ECG, oxygen saturation, and capnography monitoring. The anaesthetist is responsible for handing over the patient, who requires one-to-one care until they have regained control of their airway, are awake and able to communicate, and are stable from a cardiorespiratory perspective. There must also be specific and pre-defined discharge criteria. During the recovery phase after neuraxial anaesthesia, straight-leg raising should be used as a screening method to assess motor block. If the woman is unable to straight-leg raise at 4 h from the last dose of epidural/spinal local anaesthetic, the anaesthetist should be called to assess whether the woman's care should be escalated to investigate the possibility of reversible causes of neurological injury.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ufeffPresumption of insensibility during general anaesthesia: \\nSummary: Whilst the general presumption of the public is that general anaesthesia prevents awareness of any sensory stimuli, Lennertz and colleagues have shown in this issue of the British Journal of Anaesthesia that 11% of young adults were able to respond to auditory commands when neuromuscular blocking drugs were prevented from reaching one arm using the isolated forearm technique. This occurred with anaesthetic regimens that followed usual clinical practice in each of the 10 countries that enrolled patients, and it was significantly more common in women than in men. This high incidence demands attention. Further characterisation of the experience of these patients is essential to our understanding of the state of general anaesthesia.\\nIntroduction: ‘The operation lasted 4 or 5 min, during which time the patient betrayed occasional marks of uneasiness, but upon subsequently regaining her consciousness, she professed not only to have felt no pain but to have been insensible to surrounding objects, to have known nothing of the operation, being only uneasy about a child left at home’.\\nSince Bigelow’s initial breathless report of the demonstration of ether anaesthesia at the Massachusetts General Hospital by William Morton in 1846, the expectation amongst surgical patients is that they will be unconscious (‘insensible to surrounding objects’) during general anaesthesia. Anaesthetists routinely affirm that patients during general anaesthesia will not be aware during the procedure. Yet, that claim may be overconfident and unjustified; after all, consciousness is a subjective experience that is not directly ascertainable by an outside observer, so why are we so sure our patients are unaware during their surgical procedures? Our only way to determine that someone is conscious is to judge whether their reactions to their environment accord with\" metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' our understanding of what a conscious being would do under those circumstances. Given that balanced anaesthetic regimens prevent movement, they largely obliterate the ability of patients to respond to their environment, so our patients certainly appear unconscious, regardless of their subjective experience during the procedure.\\nFine, but patients must certainly remember if they endure something as jarring as awareness during anaesthesia, right? Overwhelmingly, our determination of a patient’s unintended awareness comes after the fact when patients recall experiences from the period when they were anaesthetised. Yet, most sedativeehypnotic agents are amnestic even at sub-hypnotic doses,\\u2006 \\u2006 so the relative rarity of reports must necessarily form a lower limit on the incidence of accidental awareness during anaesthesia. The 5th National Audit Project in the UK and Ireland found that one in 19000 general anaesthetics yielded a spontaneous report of accidental awareness by the patient, with the incidence increasing to one in 8000 cases when neuromuscular blocking drugs were used. When actively soliciting memories of the intraoperative period using a modified Brice structured interview format, the apparent incidence increases in high-risk populations by more than an order of magnitude to one in 500-600. Given that a structured interview can prompt such a huge increase in the incidence of probable awareness during anaesthesia, a number of anaesthetists have wondered about studying patients who retain a communication channel during a balanced anaesthetic to allow direct querying of the patient’s mental status in real time during anaesthetic administration.\\nTunstall proposed the isolated forearm technique (IFT) as a way to query patients directly for conscious experience during general anaesthesia in 1977. In brief, anaesthetic induction takes place as normal, but before administration of a neuromuscular blocking drug a BP cuff is inflated above arterial pressure in one arm, sparing it from delivery of the neuromuscular blocking drug. This hand is then able to squeeze in response to queries from the investigators. Through careful titration, as many as one in three patients receiving a light general anaesthetic have IFT responsiveness (i.e. they respond appropriately to questioning with a hand squeeze).\\u2006 \\u2006 In an attempt to understand the real-world incidence of IFT responsiveness during general anaesthesia, Sanders and colleagues reported in 2017 that the incidence of IFT responsiveness in a multicentre prospective cohort study of 254 patients was 4.6%, and that responders were younger than non-responders. Interestingly, none of the IFT responders had any memories of the experience.\\nIn this issue of the British Journal of Anaesthesia, an expanded research group has submitted a follow-up to their 2017 study: an international multicentre prospective cohort study designed to assess IFT responsiveness shortly after tracheal intubation in patients 18e40 yr old. For technical and philosophical reasons, the authors describe conscious awareness of study stimuli generating motor responses during general anaesthesia as ‘connected consciousness’ to emphasise that the conscious experience is connected to the outside environment, as distinct from the ‘disconnected consciousness’ of dreaming. Thus, ‘connected consciousness’ indicates some level of conscious awareness of the environment. This has perhaps added to the terminological clutter in the field, where definitions are overlapping and vary from author to author. In general, awareness has a long history as a term to describe the contents of, as opposed to level of, consciousness. Thus, connected consciousness is another name for awareness of the external environment. This does not mean that connected consciousness implies a particular type of experience (e.g. pain during the operation). Normal wakeful conscious experience is one of connected consciousness, although as we will see later, it is unclear how IFT responders experience the phenomenon. Consciousness and awareness can occur without explicit memory formation, as when not recalling your drive home from work despite awareness of the environment sufficient to avoid an accident, and false explicit memories can be formed of events that did not occur. These represent a challenge for reliable eye witness testimony\\u2006 \\u2006 and for those interested in studying awareness during anaesthesia.\\nLennertz and colleagues\\u2006 \\u2006 proposed to prospectively investigate specific risk factors for connected consciousness during general anaesthesia, including female sex and whether anaesthesia is continuously delivered during the time between induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation, and to characterise the IFT response with a mix of multiple auditory stimulus types and tests for implicit and explicit memory formation. Administration of anaesthetic drugs was at the discretion of the anaesthetist, and enrolling centres were located in 10 different countries, suggesting a relatively high external validity. Target enrolment was 500 patients, but funding constraints forced the study to stop short at 344 enrollees. Even with the decreased power, the group was able to show that young adults have an 11% response rate after intubation, with an adjusted odds ratio' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' of 2.7 for female vs male sex (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1e7.6), despite almost no differences in dosing of anaesthetics between the sexes. Delivery of anaesthesia during the interval between induction and intubation, whether by i.v. infusion, intermittent boluses, or inhalation, decreased the risk of IFT responsiveness, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.20e0.96). Responses were more likely to occur with commands than with random non-command verbal stimuli. Perhaps most concerning, 18 of 37 responders endorsed being in pain when given the command, ‘If you are in pain, squeeze my hand two times’. There was no evidence for implicit memory formation in the word retrieval assay used by the team. Finally, the Brice structured interview yielded an incidence of definite explicit recall of 0.3% (95% CI: 0.03e1.3%), consistent with that reported previously. It should be noted that assessors of IFT responsiveness were not blinded to anaesthetic dosing, and assessors of intra- operative recall were not blinded to IFT responsiveness.\\nThese results, corroborating the 2017 report, are quite disconcerting. Note that comparing incidence directly between the two studies is not possible, as the definition of a response differs between the reports. If accidental awareness does occur in ~1 in 10 young adults receiving general anaesthesia, that is orders of magnitude greater than the incidence that most anaesthetists expect and wildly discordant with public expectations. Moreover, these results suggest ~1 in 20 such adults are experiencing pain during this period of awareness.\\nAn important element of this study is the serial sampling of responsiveness over time. Such an approach is an important step for several reasons. One, effect-site concentrations are fluctuating during the period after induction, making a varying level of consciousness quite understandable, so patients might respond at some time points and not at others. A steady-state drug concentration does not guarantee stable brain electrical behaviour, but at least it is more predictable. We therefore cannot infer that this ability to parse statements was necessarily stable over time. Second, multiple repeated probes of responsiveness allow some attempt to understand the patient’s conscious experience. Are they responding to any auditory stimulus because they were instructed in advance to do so, even if they are not parsing the experience? A few patients (4/338) responded to the nonsense statement but not the command to squeeze the investigator’s hand, suggesting that this could plausibly be true, but more patients (13/338) responded only to the command and not to the nonsense statement. Use of more complicated probes (i.e. ‘If stones float on water, squeeze my hand’) could be even more revealing, but it would require more statistical power to interpret.\\nThe incongruity of patients who respond to direct queries, including queries about pain, in the affirmative but do not necessarily move spontaneously in response to surgery has prompted some to question whether the IFT response is sufficient as an indication of consciousness, and whether the degree of consciousness that it indicates is necessarily unacceptable. Whilst consciousness is not necessarily all or none, with gradations in level of arousal and content potentially mediated by anaesthetic drug effects, it would seem that decoding semantic content from an auditory stimulus and then selecting an appropriate motor response (‘If you are in pain, squeeze my hand twice’) clearly indicate some degree of consciousness. Perhaps whatever that consciousness feels like (in philosophical terms, its qualia) is not the same as normal wakeful consciousness, but if it is experienced by one in 10 young adults it seems prudent to prepare patients for that possibility.\\nThis disconcerting revelation of how much we do not understand about the conscious experience in anaesthetised patients has a clear parallel in the discovery of covert aware- ness in patients with disorders of consciousness after a brain injury, also known as cognitive-motor dissociation. This is an active area of research in disorders of consciousness. Investigators have identified that a subset of brain-injured patients have electroencephalographic or functional imaging evidence of brain activity congruent with following a command in response to verbal directions as opposed to closely matched but scrambled auditory stimuli. The ongoing work in cognitive-motor dissociation may offer some insights and methodologic inspiration for anaesthetists interested in characterising the conscious experience of patients undergoing general anaesthesia, and any resulting studies could certainly inform investigations into mechanisms of other disorders of consciousness. A number of open questions with immediate clinical relevance clearly remain. Why are women twice as likely to be IFT responders? Why does neuromuscular block increase the incidence of awareness? Is it simply that less hypnotic is administered, or is there something intrinsically ‘arousing’ about paralysis?\\nAnaesthetists, we' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' are now in an uncomfortable place where it is clear that some fraction of young patients may experience connected consciousness during general anaesthesia, but we are not yet able to determine the qualia of those connected consciousness episodes, so we cannot counsel patients about what to expect from a first-person perspective in the event of recall. At a minimum, further study into the nature of whatever conscious experience of IFT responders is necessary. This line of work may ultimately need to include setting different expectations for patients undergoing general anaesthesia, such that there is some non-zero chance that they experience ‘connected consciousness’ during anaesthesia, but what shall we say they might be aware of? As of now, all we know are the raw rates reported by Lennertz and colleagues: 11% (37/338) responded to auditory stimuli at some point, almost half of whom (18/338) responded when asked to squeeze the investigator’s hand if they were in pain, but very few (1/338) remembered the experience. The low incidence of complaints of accidental awareness with recall certainly suggests that, for the majority of these patients, the benefits of undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia outweigh the risk of the potential experience of connected consciousness during anaesthesia, and a disclosure of this poorly defined potential experience might dissuade patients from undergoing necessary procedures. Yet, a 5% incidence of connected consciousness associated with pain is high enough in this cohort that it could be argued that a reasonable person might choose to decline general anaesthesia to avoid a potentially uncomfortable experience. As a result, disclosure around the risks of awareness during general anaesthesia has been controversial. I foresee heated discussions ahead as we wrestle with the implications of this new information. Within a shared decision-making model, I would argue that, for the patient that expresses concern about being aware during anaesthesia, it is reasonable to consider beginning a risk-benefit discussion with the low incidence of accidental awareness with recall, to discuss the data of Lennertz and colleagues\\u2006 \\u2006 as we know it, to assure the patient that we will act if their vital signs suggest discomfort and to assure them we will take steps to minimise the chance of an episode of connected consciousness. For example, the results reported by Lennertz and colleagues\\u2006 \\u2006 do offer one immediate suggestion for clinical practice: providing anaesthesia continuously after induction decreases the risk of IFT response by roughly a factor of 2. It is reasonable to recommend that an induction bolus dose of hypnotic should be followed by additional anaesthetic administration, i.v. or inhaled, until the airway is secured and maintenance anaesthetic delivery begins.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ufeffIsolated hypotension after the induction of general anaesthesia refractory to fluids and vasopressors: An indicator of anaphylaxis:\\nAbstract: Differentiating between anaphylaxis and hypotension during general anaesthesia is difficult, especially when patients present with only hypotension and without any of the other classical features of anaphylaxis. We report the successful management of an anaphylactic reaction to rocuronium that presented as isolated hypotension in a 45-year-old Indonesian man presented with lacerations on the scalp and right pinna caused by an assault to the head after the induction of general anaesthesia, refractory to fluids and high doses of vasopressors. This case highlights that a possible indicator of anaphylaxis can be the presence of isolated hypotension during general anaesthesia, refractory to vasopressor agents. \\n\\nINTRODUCTION:\\nIntraoperative hypotension during general anaesthesia is a more common problem than perioperative anaphylaxis, whose incidence is estimated to be 1:10000.\\u2006 \\u2006 Failure to differentiate between the two can lead to a delay in definitive treatment, which is a risk factor for mortality. Our case highlights the importance of identifying isolated refractory hypotension after the induction of general anaesthesia, as this may be the only indicator of anaphylaxis. We report a case of isolated hypotension during general anaesthesia who are refractory to fluids and repeated doses of vasopressors, anaphylaxis should be suspected, and a test dose of intravenous adrenaline can be administered earlier for better clinical outcome. \\n\\nCASE REPORT:\\nA 45-year-old Indonesian man presented with lacerations on the scalp and right pinna caused by an assault to the head. He was scheduled for emergency wound debridement, toilet, and suturing of the scalp. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan revealed no intracranial bleeding. Multiple facial bone fractures were observed and conservative management of these was recommended.\\nThe patient had no history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure or any other medical problem. He had no known history of any surgery. He did' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' not smoke cigarettes and had no known allergies. His functional status was good. His peripheries were warm, his vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 134/75 mmHg and there were no signs of active bleeding, anaemia or electrolyte imbalance. He was mildly dehydrated, with a coated tongue, and capillary refill time of 2 seconds. Pain was tolerable with pain score of 3.\\nElectrocardiography showed a sinus tachycardia of 120 beats per minute. Chest radiography was normal, with no signs of pneumothorax. Other preoperative assessments were within normal range. Renal profile revealed a urea of 5.1 mmol/L and creatinine of 85 micromole/L. Six hours prior to the operation, an intravenous dose of ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) was administered in the emergency department.\\nGeneral anaesthesia was induced with the intravenous administration of fentanyl (2 mcg/kg), propofol (2 mg/kg), and rocuronium (1 mg/kg). The patient was intubated, and general anaesthesia was maintained with 2.5% sevoflurane in an oxygen/air mixture. He was ventilated on pressure control ventilation, inspiratory pressure of 14, rate 12, Fio2: 0.4, Peep 6.\\nAfter 5 minutes of general anaesthesia, the patient developed hypotension (65–80/40–50) based on the first reading from non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. The operation had not yet started and skin preparation with chlorhexidine was not applied on the patient. Differential diagnoses such as pneumothorax, sepsis, and myocardial infarction were ruled out. The patient displayed a tachycardia of 105 beats per minute, a decrease, compared to the rate measured prior to the induction of general anaesthesia. No obvious ischemic changes were observed in the electrocardiographic readings. A carotid pulse was present. Peak pressure from the ventilator was 20 cm H20 with similar initial ventilator setting and the end tidal carbon dioxide measurement was 25 mmHg. There was no decrease in oxygen saturation or signs of fever, flushing, urticaria, or bronchospasm. A measurement of venous blood gases 30 minutes into anaesthesia indicated a state of metabolic acidosis with pH 7.15, bicarbonate level 15.5 mmol/L, potassium level 4.0 mmol/L, and haemoglobin level 10.8 g/dL.\\nThe patient did not respond to the usual boluses of vasopressors such as phenylephrine (total dose 2 mg) and ephedrine (total dose 30 mg). A total of 30 mL/kg of Ringers lactate was administered as fluid resuscitation; noradrenaline infusion was started up from an initial dose of 0.1mcg/kg/min, titrated up to 0.8mcg/kg/min as shown in Figure 1. Despite these measures, a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg could not be achieved. Anaphylaxis was suspected and the patient was given a single bolus dose of adrenaline 100 mcg (1:10000). The blood pressure responded to this bolus dose, with a surge in blood pressure up to 200/70 mmHg. Intravenous adrenaline was then initiated up to an infusion rate of 0.28mcg/kg/min through a newly inserted femoral central venous line. The patient’s blood pressure was maintained at a range of 140–200/60–90 mmHg. Intravenous hydrocortisone (200 mg) and chlorpheniramine (10 mg) were administered intraoperatively as part of the anaphylaxis treatment.\\nThe surgery commenced 15 minutes post induction as patient was initially treated as usual post general anaesthesia hypotension. Estimated blood loss was minimal and a total fluid of 3 litres were given intraoperatively (2500 ml of Ringer lactate plus 500 ml of Albumin 5%). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively, where he was placed on a ventilator for 1 day. He was also supported haemodynamically with Noradrenaline 0.1mcg/kg/min and Adrenaline of 0.4mcg/kg/min. Measurement of his blood gases on entry into the ICU indicated a more severe metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.0 and bicarbonate of 7.0 mmol/L. With no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis, the metabolic acidosis was managed according to standard treatment guidelines. His postoperative haemoglobin level was 10.5 g/dL while his kidney function showed a deterioration' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n",
      "text=' with creatinine level 111 micromole/L and urea level 5.3 mmol/L. Clinically, he was not dehydrated with the initial inferior venous cava scan of 1.6 cm. Transthoracic echocardiography indicated the absence of valve and regional wall motion abnormalities. All the cardiac chambers were of normal size with good right and left ventricular function. Ejection fraction was more than 60%.\\nOn day 2 of ICU admission, the patient showed significant clinical improvement; he was fully conscious and on low setting pressure support ventilation. He was weaned off from inotropic support with resolved tachycardia. His blood gases and kidney functions returned to normal, with good urine output. He was extubated and discharged after 2 days and given an allergy card, indicating his possible rocuronium allergy. The patient refused to undergo any allergy skin testing after receiving advice regarding its risks and benefits.\\nDISCUSSION:\\nAnaphylaxis has always posed a diagnostic challenge. One study reported that up to 40% of all patients who died because of anaphylaxis, did not receive any adrenaline.3 Our diagnosis of anaphylaxis was based on clinical observations. These include the responsiveness of the patient’s hemodynamic to a single bolus dose of adrenaline, the resistance to vasopressors, and the relatively short recovery time in the ICU.\\nOnly 5.6% of patients with anaphylaxis present with isolated cardiovascular features.1 Hypotension after induction of general anaesthesia is more common, especially when propofol is used for induction. Except for tachycardia, which our patient had prior to the operation, there was no evidence of the other classical features of anaphylaxis. The anomalous presentation of the anaphylaxis resulted in a delay in the implementation of treatment plan.\\nThe first limitation of this study was our inability to obtain the patient’s serum tryptase levels. However, since not all anaphylactic situations produce an elevation of tryptase level, a normal tryptase level does not exclude the diagnosis.\\nThe second limitation was our inability to persuade the patient to undergo allergy skin tests, mainly due to his cost constraints. Thus, the aetiology of anaphylaxis in this case remains unknown. The administration of antibiotics 6 hours prior to the operation was uneventful. The use of propofol and fentanyl was less likely to be the cause. The 6th National Audit Project has showed that the drugs most commonly involved in anaphylaxis are antibiotics (48%) followed by neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD) (25%).1 Another study on anaphylaxis in anaesthesia also found that NMBDs (61%) were most responsible for anaphylaxis.4 Additionally, around 95% of reactions involving NMBD presented within 5 minutes.1 Therefore, based on the evidence and timing of the event the cause of the anaphylaxis in this study was presumed to be rocuronium.\\nAlthough the patient had no previous anaesthetic history, evidence has shown that anaphylaxis can still occur as the quaternary ammonium group of the NMBD is found in many foods and over the counter drugs. Cross-sensitization through exposure to the ammonium group may explain why allergic reactions to NMBD can occasionally occur upon initial exposure to rocuronium.\\nAdrenaline is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis as it offers greater physiological benefits. In our case, the patient’s deterioration could have been avoided if adrenaline had been administered first instead of noradrenaline. After the administration of adrenaline, noradrenaline was weaned off without any lowering of the blood pressure. The triggering threshold based on the total dose of vasopressor given before the single bolus dose of adrenaline is unknown. This provides a basis and direction for future research.\\nIn conclusion, our case highlights the importance of identifying isolated refractory hypotension after the induction of general anaesthesia, as this may be the only indicator of anaphylaxis. We also recommend that intravenous adrenaline be administered earlier to such hypotensive patients who are refractory to fluids and repeated doses of vasopressors. This early identification will enable early administration of adrenaline and hence, improve morbidity and mortality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ' metadata={'source': 'example'}\n"
